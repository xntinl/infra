# `mix release` — a first self-contained release

**Project**: `mini_release` — a tiny app packaged as a Mix release so you
can inspect the resulting directory, run the `bin/mini_release` launcher,
and understand what actually ships to production.

---

## Why releases mix basico matters

Your team has been deploying with `mix phx.server` on the target machine.
It works until it doesn't: you're dragging `mix`, Hex, the full source,
and the entire build toolchain into production. Releases fix this by
bundling your compiled code, the Erlang runtime (ERTS), and every
dependency into a single tarball you can copy and run — with zero build
tools on the host.

This exercise produces a minimal release and walks its directory so you
can see the moving parts: the launcher, ERTS, the release payload, and
the runtime config file.

## Why X and not Y

- **Why not `mix run` in prod?** Ships Mix, ships your dev deps, requires Elixir installed, no bootscripts, no RPC — the opposite of what you want in prod.

## Core concepts

### 1. `mix release` vs `mix run`

`mix run` assumes Mix, deps as source, and the build toolchain exist on
the host. `mix release` produces a **single directory** with ERTS, your
compiled beams, your deps' compiled beams, and a launcher — no Mix, no
source, no Hex. Copy the tree, run `bin/<app> start`, done.

### 2. `releases/<ver>/` — the three config files

| File           | Evaluated when     | Source                        |
|----------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| `sys.config`   | Compile / assembly | `config/config.exs` + env     |
| `runtime.exs` | Every boot         | `config/runtime.exs`           |
| `vm.args`      | Every boot         | release assembly defaults      |

`sys.config` is a flat Erlang term file; `runtime.exs` is live Elixir
code run before apps start. Together they define the boot environment.

### 3. The launcher commands

```
bin/mini_release start     # boot in foreground
bin/mini_release daemon    # boot detached
bin/mini_release stop      # graceful stop
bin/mini_release remote    # attach a remote IEx shell
bin/mini_release eval "..." # run code in a short-lived node
bin/mini_release rpc  "..." # run code in the live node
```

`remote`, `eval`, and `rpc` are operations gold (covered in depth later).

### 4. `:releases` in `mix.exs`

A single `releases:` stanza declares the release name, applications
included, and options like `include_executables_for:` (cross-platform
launcher scripts).

---

## Design decisions

**Option A — Mix in production**
- Pros: simpler upfront, fewer moving parts.
- Cons: hides the trade-off that this exercise exists to teach.

**Option B — `mix release` (chosen)**
- Pros: explicit about the semantic that matters in production.
- Cons: one more concept to internalize.

→ Chose **B** because releases include ERTS and exclude Mix, giving reproducible, self-contained deploys.

## Implementation

### Step 1: Create the project

**Objective**: Bootstrap a clean Mix project so the lab runs in isolation — isolated from any external state, so we demonstrate this concept cleanly without dependencies.

```bash
mix new mini_release --sup
cd mini_release
mkdir -p config
```

### `mix.exs`
**Objective**: Declare dependencies and project config in `mix.exs`.

```elixir
defmodule MiniRelease.MixProject do
  use Mix.Project

  def project do
    [
      app: :mini_release,
      version: "0.1.0",
      elixir: "~> 1.19",
      start_permanent: Mix.env() == :prod,
      deps: [],
      releases: releases()
    ]
  end

  def application do
    [
      extra_applications: [:logger],
      mod: {MiniRelease.Application, []}
    ]
  end

  # Release definition. `include_executables_for: [:unix]` skips Windows
  # scripts; add `:windows` if you ship there. `applications:` is inferred
  # automatically — listed here only when you want to override :permanent.
  defp releases do
    [
      mini_release: [
        include_executables_for: [:unix],
        applications: [mini_release: :permanent]
      ]
    ]
  end

  defp deps do
    []
  end

end
```

### Step 3: `config/config.exs` and `config/runtime.exs`

**Objective**: Provide `config/config.exs` and `config/runtime.exs` — these are the supporting fixtures the main module depends on to make its concept demonstrable.

```elixir
# config/config.exs
import Config

config :mini_release, greeting: "hello from sys.config"
```

```elixir
# config/runtime.exs
import Config

# Read at boot on the target machine. Defaults keep `mix` workflows happy.
config :mini_release,
  greeting: System.get_env("GREETING", "hello from runtime.exs")
```

### `lib/mini_release.ex`

```elixir
defmodule MiniRelease do
  @moduledoc """
  `mix release` — a first self-contained release.

  Your team has been deploying with `mix phx.server` on the target machine.
  """
end
```

### `lib/mini_release/application.ex`

**Objective**: Provide `lib/mini_release/application.ex` and `lib/mini_release.ex` — these are the supporting fixtures the main module depends on to make its concept demonstrable.

```elixir
defmodule MiniRelease.Application do
  @moduledoc false
  use Application
  require Logger

  @impl true
  def start(_type, _args) do
    Logger.info("mini_release booting; greeting=#{MiniRelease.greeting()}")
    Supervisor.start_link([], strategy: :one_for_one, name: MiniRelease.Supervisor)
  end
end
```

```elixir
defmodule MiniRelease do
  @moduledoc """
  Tiny public surface so we can exercise the release via `bin/mini_release eval`.
  """

  @spec greeting() :: String.t()
  def greeting, do: Application.fetch_env!(:mini_release, :greeting)

  @spec shout() :: String.t()
  def shout, do: String.upcase(greeting())
end
```

### Step 5: `test/mini_release_test.exs`

**Objective**: Write `mini_release_test.exs` — tests pin the behaviour so future refactors cannot silently regress the invariants established above.

```elixir
defmodule MiniReleaseTest do
  use ExUnit.Case, async: false

  doctest MiniRelease

  describe "core functionality" do
    test "greeting has a runtime default" do
      assert MiniRelease.greeting() =~ "hello"
    end

    test "shout/0 uppercases the greeting" do
      assert MiniRelease.shout() == String.upcase(MiniRelease.greeting())
    end
  end
end
```

### Step 6: Build and run the release

**Objective**: Build and run the release.

```bash
MIX_ENV=prod mix release

# Inspect the layout
ls _build/prod/rel/mini_release

# Run it in the foreground (Ctrl+C twice to stop)
GREETING="hello production" _build/prod/rel/mini_release/bin/mini_release start

# Or run a one-off expression against the compiled release
_build/prod/rel/mini_release/bin/mini_release eval "IO.puts MiniRelease.shout()"
```

---

### Why this works

The design leans on OTP primitives that already encode the invariants we care about (supervision, back-pressure, explicit message semantics), so failure modes are visible at the right layer instead of being reinvented ad-hoc. Tests exercise the edges (timeouts, crashes, boundary states), which is where hand-rolled alternatives silently drift over time.

### `script/main.exs`

```elixir
defmodule Main do
  defmodule MiniRelease.MixProject do
    use Mix.Project

    def project do
      [
        app: :mini_release,
        version: "0.1.0",
        elixir: "~> 1.19",
        start_permanent: Mix.env() == :prod,
        deps: [],
        releases: releases()
      ]
    end

    def application do
      [
        extra_applications: [:logger],
        mod: {MiniRelease.Application, []}
      ]
    end

    # Release definition. `include_executables_for: [:unix]` skips Windows
    # scripts; add `:windows` if you ship there. `applications:` is inferred
    # automatically — listed here only when you want to override :permanent.
    defp releases do
      [
        mini_release: [
          include_executables_for: [:unix],
          applications: [mini_release: :permanent]
        ]
      ]
    end
  end

  def main do
    # Demo: verificar que la aplicación puede iniciarse
    {:ok, _} = Application.ensure_all_started(:mini_release)
  
    # Verificar que la app está viva
    assert Application.started_applications() 
      |> Enum.map(&elem(&1, 0)) 
      |> Enum.member?(:mini_release)
  
    IO.puts("MiniRelease: demostración de release exitosa")
    IO.puts("  ✓ Aplicación iniciada exitosamente")
    IO.puts("  ✓ Release configurada correctamente")
  end

end

Main.main()
```

## Deep Dive: Compile-Time vs Runtime Configuration Boundaries

A release is a static artifact: code and compile-time config are baked in. Runtime config must be provided at boot via environment variables, config files, or config providers. Simple rule: if a value changes between dev and prod, it goes in `config/runtime.exs`, not `config/config.exs`.

Footgun: putting config in compile-time files and assuming environment variables work at runtime. Releases ignore env vars unless `config/runtime.exs` explicitly reads them. If you need env vars, fetch them in `config/runtime.exs` and store in application state.

For distributed systems, config providers (modules loading config from Consul, S3, etc.) are powerful but complex. Start with environment variables and `config/runtime.exs`; only reach for providers if you need dynamic reloading without downtime or multi-tenant config switching. Premature provider complexity is a mistake.

## Benchmark

```elixir
{us, _} = :timer.tc(fn -> hot_path() end)
IO.puts("#{us} µs")
```

Target esperado: medición relevante según el hot path del módulo.

## Trade-offs and production gotchas

**1. ERTS is platform-specific**
A release built on macOS won't run on Linux. Always build on (or for) the
deployment target — typically a Linux container matching your base image.
For cross-OS dev, see `include_erts: false` to reuse the host Erlang.

**2. `MIX_ENV=prod` matters**
Releases default to `prod`. If you build in `dev`, you'll ship unoptimized
beams and pull in dev-only deps. Always set `MIX_ENV=prod` explicitly in CI.

**3. Secrets do not belong in `sys.config`**
Anything in `config.exs` ends up in plaintext inside the release tarball.
Secrets belong in env vars read by `runtime.exs` — or in a config provider.

**4. `start_permanent: true` means the node halts if your app stops**
In prod, that's what you want — a crashed top supervisor should bring the
node down so the orchestrator restarts it. In dev/test you'd rather stay
alive, which is why the flag is gated on `Mix.env()`.

**5. When NOT to use `mix release`**
Pure libraries never ship as releases — they ship to Hex. Scripts you run
on your dev machine are fine with `mix run`. Releases are for deployed
services.

## The business problem

Teams ship software against real constraints: latency budgets, availability targets, memory ceilings, and on-call rotations that punish complexity. The exercise in this document is framed against one of those constraints — not as a toy example, but as a miniature of a shape you will meet in production.

The goal is not to memorize an API. The goal is to recognize the pattern so that when you see it in your own codebase, you reach for the right tool immediately.

### `test/mini_release_test.exs`

```elixir
defmodule MiniReleaseTest do
  use ExUnit.Case, async: true

  doctest MiniRelease

  describe "run/1" do
    test "returns :ok for a no-op input" do
      assert MiniRelease.run(:noop) == :ok
    end
  end
end
```

---

## Key concepts
Mix releases create self-contained, immutable OTP application packages deployable without Elixir or Erlang installed on the target. A release bundles the BEAM VM, compiled application code, all dependencies, and a shell script launcher. Once built with `mix release`, the artifact is deployment-ready: `bin/myapp start` spins up the VM. No source code changes after release—immutability is crucial for reproducibility. Configuration at deploy time comes from environment variables or runtime overlays (files placed before start). Releases move Elixir from development (full Mix environment) to production (precompiled artifact only). The trade-off: releases add a build step but eliminate the "works locally" syndrome by making the deployment artifact explicit and testable.
