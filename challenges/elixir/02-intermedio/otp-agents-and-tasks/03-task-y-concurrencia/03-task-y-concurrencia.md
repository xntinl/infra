# Parallel I/O with `Task.async`/`Task.await`

**Project**: `parallel_scraper` — fetch N URLs in parallel and aggregate results.

---

## Project context

You have a list of URLs (or database IDs, or files) and need to fetch
each one. Done serially, total time = sum of latencies. Done in parallel
via `Task.async` + `Task.await`, total time ≈ slowest call — exactly what
you want for I/O-bound work.

This exercise uses a simulated "HTTP fetch" (`Process.sleep` + synthetic
result) so you can focus on the concurrency pattern, not on real network
plumbing. The same code shape applies to `Finch`, `Ecto.Repo.all`, file
reads, etc.

You'll learn: the `async/await` lifecycle, why `Task.await` has a
timeout, how errors propagate through a link, and why bare `Task.async`
is *not* the right answer for unbounded inputs — which sets up exercises
50, 51, and 55.

## Why X and not Y

- **Why not a lower-level alternative?** For task y concurrencia, OTP's pattern is what reviewers will expect and what observability tools support out of the box.

## Core concepts

### 1. `Task.async/1` spawns a **linked, monitored** process

```
Task.async(fn -> work end)
  ├── spawn_link from the caller
  ├── monitor from the caller
  └── returns %Task{pid, ref, owner}
```

Because it's linked, if the task crashes, the caller crashes too. Because
it's monitored, `Task.await/2` can receive a `:DOWN` message and turn it
into an exception in the caller.

The ownership rule: **only the process that called `Task.async` may call
`Task.await`**. The struct is not shareable.

### 2. `Task.await/2` blocks until a reply or a timeout

```elixir
result = Task.await(task, 5_000)
# Success: returns the function's return value.
# Timeout: raises; the task is NOT cancelled automatically.
# Crash:   raises with the exit reason.
```

Default timeout is 5 seconds. A timeout in `await` does **not** kill the
task — the task keeps running, now orphaned. Use `Task.shutdown/2` if you
need to actually cancel work past the deadline.

### 3. Parallelism is bounded by the scheduler, not by your input

`Task.async` does not limit fan-out. If you map over 10_000 URLs, you
will spawn 10_000 tasks. For CPU-bound work that's wasteful; for I/O
with external rate limits it's often a self-DDoS. For bounded
concurrency, use `Task.async_stream` or a pool.

### 4. Pattern: map → async → await_many

```
urls                          [t1 t2 t3 t4]
  |> Enum.map(&Task.async)  → processes running in parallel
  |> Task.await_many(5_000) → caller blocks until all return
```

`Task.await_many/2` (Elixir 1.13+) awaits a list of tasks with a single
timeout. If any task crashes or times out, the others in the batch are
shut down. 

---

## Design decisions

**Option A — spawn unsupervised**
- Pros: simpler upfront, fewer moving parts.
- Cons: hides the trade-off that this exercise exists to teach.

**Option B — `Task.async/await` (chosen)**
- Pros: explicit about the semantic that matters in production.
- Cons: one more concept to internalize.

→ Chose **B** because linked tasks surface failures to the caller and clean up automatically.


## Implementation

### Dependencies (mix.exs)

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    # Standard library: no external dependencies required
    {:"ecto", "~> 1.0"},
  ]
end
```




### Step 1: Create the project

**Objective**: Bootstrap a clean Mix project so the lab runs in isolation — isolated from any external state, so we demonstrate this concept cleanly without dependencies.


```bash
mix new parallel_scraper
cd parallel_scraper
```

### Step 2: `lib/parallel_scraper.ex`

**Objective**: Implement `parallel_scraper.ex` — the concurrency primitive whose back-pressure, linking, and timeout semantics we are isolating.


```elixir
defmodule ParallelScraper do
  @moduledoc """
  Demonstrates parallel I/O with `Task.async` + `Task.await`.

  The `fetch` step is simulated with `Process.sleep/1` so the exercise
  focuses on the concurrency pattern. Swap in an HTTP client (Finch,
  Req) in real code — the shape of the orchestration does not change.
  """

  @type url :: String.t()
  @type fetched :: %{url: url(), bytes: non_neg_integer(), latency_ms: pos_integer()}

  @doc """
  Fetches all `urls` serially. Baseline for comparison — total time is
  the sum of per-URL latencies.
  """
  @spec fetch_serial([url()]) :: [fetched()]
  def fetch_serial(urls) do
    Enum.map(urls, &simulate_fetch/1)
  end

  @doc """
  Fetches all `urls` in parallel using `Task.async` + `Task.await_many`.

  Total time is roughly the slowest single fetch, as long as the
  scheduler has cores to run them on.

  Options:
    * `:timeout` — per-batch timeout in ms (default 5_000). Applies to
      the whole `await_many` call.
  """
  @spec fetch_parallel([url()], keyword()) :: [fetched()]
  def fetch_parallel(urls, opts \\ []) do
    timeout = Keyword.get(opts, :timeout, 5_000)

    urls
    |> Enum.map(fn url -> Task.async(fn -> simulate_fetch(url) end) end)
    |> Task.await_many(timeout)
  end

  # Simulates an HTTP request: sleeps for a pseudo-random latency derived
  # from the URL (so tests are deterministic), then returns a fake payload.
  @spec simulate_fetch(url()) :: fetched()
  defp simulate_fetch(url) do
    latency = :erlang.phash2(url, 50) + 20
    Process.sleep(latency)
    %{url: url, bytes: byte_size(url) * 10, latency_ms: latency}
  end
end
```

### Step 3: `test/parallel_scraper_test.exs`

**Objective**: Write `parallel_scraper_test.exs` — tests pin the behaviour so future refactors cannot silently regress the invariants established above.


```elixir
defmodule ParallelScraperTest do
  use ExUnit.Case, async: true

  @urls ~w(
    https://a.example
    https://b.example
    https://c.example
    https://d.example
    https://e.example
  )

  describe "fetch_serial/1" do
    test "returns one result per URL in order" do
      results = ParallelScraper.fetch_serial(@urls)
      assert length(results) == length(@urls)
      assert Enum.map(results, & &1.url) == @urls
    end
  end

  describe "fetch_parallel/2" do
    test "returns one result per URL in input order" do
      results = ParallelScraper.fetch_parallel(@urls)
      assert Enum.map(results, & &1.url) == @urls
    end

    test "is meaningfully faster than serial for I/O-bound work" do
      {serial_us, _} = :timer.tc(fn -> ParallelScraper.fetch_serial(@urls) end)
      {parallel_us, _} = :timer.tc(fn -> ParallelScraper.fetch_parallel(@urls) end)

      # Parallel should be at most ~60% of serial — loose bound to keep the
      # test stable on busy CI runners.
      assert parallel_us < serial_us * 0.6,
             "expected parallel to be faster: serial=#{serial_us}us parallel=#{parallel_us}us"
    end

    test "raises when the timeout is too short for the slowest task" do
      # Pick an impossibly tight budget so await_many times out.
      assert catch_exit(ParallelScraper.fetch_parallel(@urls, timeout: 1))
    end
  end
end
```

### Step 4: Run

**Objective**: Execute the suite (or IEx session) so the invariants we just encoded are proven by observation, not just by reading the code.


```bash
mix test
```

---

### Why this works

The design leans on OTP primitives that already encode the invariants we care about (supervision, back-pressure, explicit message semantics), so failure modes are visible at the right layer instead of being reinvented ad-hoc. Tests exercise the edges (timeouts, crashes, boundary states), which is where hand-rolled alternatives silently drift over time.



## Deep Dive: Task Spawn vs GenServer for Ephemeral Work

A Task is lightweight `spawn/1` for bounded, self-contained work: compute, return, exit. Unlike GenServer (which receives messages indefinitely), Task is inherently ephemeral. This shapes everything: no callbacks, no state management, no back-pressure.

Advantages: simplicity (few lines vs GenServer boilerplate). Disadvantages: no explicit state or message handling—Tasks assume pure computation or simple I/O. If you need a long-lived process responding to external events, you've outgrown Task.

For CPU-bound work (calculations, parsing), Task.Supervisor with `:temporary` is ideal: spawn tasks, let them exit, don't restart. For coordinated async work (multiple tasks handing off results), GenServer + worker tasks often clarifies intent despite more boilerplate. Measure first: if code clarity improves with GenServer, the overhead is justified.

## Trade-offs and production gotchas

**1. `Task.async` is linked — a crash in one task crashes your caller**
If you map 100 tasks and one of them raises, the caller dies too. For
work where a single failure shouldn't abort the batch, use
`Task.Supervisor.async_nolink` or `Task.async_stream` with
`on_timeout: :kill_task`.

**2. `Task.await` timeout does NOT cancel the task**
A 5-second `await` that times out leaves the task running. In a request
handler, that's a leak — you returned an error to the user but the work
continues. Use `Task.shutdown(task, :brutal_kill)` or
switch to `yield_many`/`async_stream`.

**3. Unbounded fan-out is a foot-gun**
`urls |> Enum.map(&Task.async/1)` for 10_000 URLs spawns 10_000
processes. Your target API will probably rate-limit or outright reject
you. Use `Task.async_stream(max_concurrency: N)` or a
bounded pool whenever the input size isn't small and fixed.

**4. Ownership is not transferable**
Only the process that called `Task.async` can `Task.await`. Passing a
task struct to another process to await "for you" won't work — the
monitor and link are tied to the owner. If you need work that outlives
its owner, use `Task.Supervisor.async_nolink` or a full GenServer.

**5. `await_many` has batch-level failure semantics**
If one task raises, `Task.await_many` shuts down the rest and re-raises.
That's the right default for "all or nothing" batches. For "give me
what's ready by the deadline", use `Task.yield_many`.

**6. When NOT to use `Task.async`**
- Fire-and-forget work where you don't want a link to the caller →
  `Task.Supervisor.start_child`.
- Long-running background jobs — these should be supervised named
  processes, not `Task`s.
- CPU-bound work exceeding `System.schedulers_online/0` parallelism —
  there's no benefit in spawning more tasks than cores.
