# Local pub/sub with a duplicate-keyed Registry

**Project**: `local_pubsub` — a minimal in-process pub/sub bus built on `Registry` in `:duplicate` mode.

**Difficulty**: ★★★☆☆
**Estimated time**: 2–3 hours

---

## Project context

You need a lightweight "publish to a topic, many listeners receive" primitive
for a single node — for example, to notify a pool of websocket handlers that
an entity changed, or to broadcast cache invalidations between a few
GenServers in the same app. You don't want Phoenix.PubSub (too heavy for
non-Phoenix apps) and you don't want your own ETS plumbing.

`Registry` in `:duplicate` mode is exactly this primitive. Each subscriber
registers under a topic key; publishing dispatches the message to every
registered process. It's a couple dozen lines and it scales well to
thousands of subscribers per topic on one node.

This is in fact how `Phoenix.PubSub.PG2` used to be built, and it's the
canonical "local pubsub" pattern in the Elixir ecosystem.

## Core concepts

### 1. `:duplicate` keys = many pids per key

```
:unique     {"room:1", pid_a}                 one owner per key
:duplicate  {"room:1", pid_a}, {"room:1", pid_b}, {"room:1", pid_c}
```

A duplicate registry is a multi-map from key → `[{pid, value}]`. The same
pid can even register multiple entries under the same key — each is
independently removable. This is the shape you want for topic subscriptions.

### 2. `Registry.dispatch/3` — the fan-out primitive

```elixir
Registry.dispatch(MyReg, "topic", fn entries ->
  for {pid, _value} <- entries, do: send(pid, {:broadcast, msg})
end)
```

`dispatch/3` invokes your callback once per partition with the list of
`{pid, value}` entries for that key. Compared to `lookup/2` + manual
iteration, it's safer (no snapshot-then-send race) and it integrates with
`:partitions` (exercise 82) to fan out in parallel.

### 3. The subscriber is the registered process

Whoever calls `Registry.register/3` is the subscriber — the pid stored is
`self()`. There is no "subscription object" to keep around: when the
subscriber dies, the registry removes the entry automatically. That's
a huge ergonomic win over ad-hoc lists of pids.

### 4. Values as filters / metadata

The third argument to `register/3` is arbitrary metadata stored alongside
the pid. Common uses: filter expressions, subscriber-type tags, or message
transforms applied before `send/2`. For a starter pubsub, pass `nil`.

## Implementation

### Step 1: Create the project

```bash
mix new local_pubsub --sup
cd local_pubsub
```

### Step 2: `lib/local_pubsub/application.ex`

```elixir
defmodule LocalPubsub.Application do
  @moduledoc false
  use Application

  @impl true
  def start(_type, _args) do
    children = [
      # :duplicate lets the same topic have many subscribers.
      # No partitions here — exercise 82 covers that.
      {Registry, keys: :duplicate, name: LocalPubsub.Registry}
    ]

    Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one, name: LocalPubsub.Supervisor)
  end
end
```

### Step 3: `lib/local_pubsub.ex`

```elixir
defmodule LocalPubsub do
  @moduledoc """
  A tiny local pub/sub bus backed by a `:duplicate`-keyed Registry.

  Subscribers register themselves under a topic; publishers call
  `broadcast/2`, which fans the message out to every subscriber's mailbox.
  Subscriptions are automatically cleaned up when subscribers exit.
  """

  @registry LocalPubsub.Registry

  @type topic :: String.t()
  @type message :: term()

  @doc """
  Subscribes the calling process to `topic`. The process will receive
  `{:pubsub, topic, message}` for every subsequent `broadcast/2`.

  Optional `filter` is an arbitrary metadata term stored with the entry —
  `broadcast/2` delivers it back so the subscriber can implement
  server-side filtering.
  """
  @spec subscribe(topic(), term()) :: :ok
  def subscribe(topic, filter \\ nil) when is_binary(topic) do
    {:ok, _} = Registry.register(@registry, topic, filter)
    :ok
  end

  @doc """
  Unsubscribes the calling process from `topic`. Does nothing if the
  caller was not subscribed.
  """
  @spec unsubscribe(topic()) :: :ok
  def unsubscribe(topic) when is_binary(topic) do
    Registry.unregister(@registry, topic)
  end

  @doc """
  Publishes `message` to everyone subscribed to `topic`. Returns the
  number of subscribers delivered to.

  We use `dispatch/3` instead of `lookup/2` + manual iteration because
  `dispatch/3` is partition-aware and does not materialize the full
  subscriber list when running against a partitioned registry.
  """
  @spec broadcast(topic(), message()) :: non_neg_integer()
  def broadcast(topic, message) when is_binary(topic) do
    counter = :counters.new(1, [:atomics])

    Registry.dispatch(@registry, topic, fn entries ->
      for {pid, _filter} <- entries do
        send(pid, {:pubsub, topic, message})
        :counters.add(counter, 1, 1)
      end
    end)

    :counters.get(counter, 1)
  end

  @doc """
  Returns the current number of subscribers for `topic`. Useful for
  debugging and for "nobody listening, skip the expensive payload" checks.
  """
  @spec subscribers(topic()) :: non_neg_integer()
  def subscribers(topic) when is_binary(topic) do
    length(Registry.lookup(@registry, topic))
  end
end
```

### Step 4: `test/local_pubsub_test.exs`

```elixir
defmodule LocalPubsubTest do
  use ExUnit.Case, async: false

  describe "subscribe/2 and broadcast/2" do
    test "delivers to one subscriber" do
      :ok = LocalPubsub.subscribe("news")
      assert LocalPubsub.broadcast("news", :hello) == 1
      assert_receive {:pubsub, "news", :hello}, 100
    end

    test "delivers to many subscribers" do
      parent = self()

      pids =
        for i <- 1..5 do
          spawn_link(fn ->
            LocalPubsub.subscribe("chatter")
            send(parent, {:ready, i})
            receive do
              {:pubsub, "chatter", msg} -> send(parent, {:got, i, msg})
            end
          end)
        end

      for i <- 1..5, do: assert_receive({:ready, ^i}, 200)

      assert LocalPubsub.broadcast("chatter", :ping) == 5
      for i <- 1..5, do: assert_receive({:got, ^i, :ping}, 200)

      Enum.each(pids, &Process.exit(&1, :normal))
    end

    test "does not deliver to unrelated topics" do
      :ok = LocalPubsub.subscribe("topic-a")
      assert LocalPubsub.broadcast("topic-b", :ignore) == 0
      refute_receive {:pubsub, _, _}, 50
    end
  end

  describe "unsubscribe/1" do
    test "stops delivery to the caller" do
      :ok = LocalPubsub.subscribe("once")
      :ok = LocalPubsub.unsubscribe("once")
      LocalPubsub.broadcast("once", :silence)
      refute_receive {:pubsub, _, _}, 50
    end
  end

  describe "auto-cleanup on subscriber death" do
    test "dead subscribers are dropped before the next broadcast" do
      parent = self()

      pid =
        spawn(fn ->
          LocalPubsub.subscribe("vanish")
          send(parent, :subscribed)
          receive do :stop -> :ok end
        end)

      assert_receive :subscribed, 200
      assert LocalPubsub.subscribers("vanish") == 1

      ref = Process.monitor(pid)
      send(pid, :stop)
      assert_receive {:DOWN, ^ref, :process, ^pid, _}, 200

      # Registry cleanup is async; wait briefly.
      wait_until(fn -> LocalPubsub.subscribers("vanish") == 0 end)
    end
  end

  defp wait_until(fun, deadline \\ 500) do
    cond do
      fun.() -> :ok
      deadline <= 0 -> flunk("timeout")
      true -> (Process.sleep(10); wait_until(fun, deadline - 10))
    end
  end
end
```

### Step 5: Run

```bash
mix test
```

## Trade-offs and production gotchas

**1. Delivery is best-effort, not reliable**
`send/2` is a fire-and-forget over a local mailbox. If a subscriber is
slow, the BEAM will happily queue messages until it runs out of memory.
For reliable delivery you need acknowledgements, backpressure, or a real
message bus.

**2. Subscribers must handle the message pattern**
Every subscriber pid must have a `receive` or `handle_info` matching
`{:pubsub, topic, message}`. A GenServer without that clause will log a
warning on every broadcast. Document the envelope shape like any other API.

**3. No ordering guarantee across subscribers**
Two subscribers to the same topic may see messages in different orders
relative to each other (they won't reorder for a single subscriber from a
single publisher). Don't build CRDT-style invariants on the bus.

**4. One registry, many topics — not "one registry per topic"**
You only need a single `Registry` for the entire application; topics are
just keys. Starting a registry per topic is a common beginner mistake —
it serializes registration through the ALERT process and gives you nothing.

**5. `dispatch/3` runs in the caller process by default**
A slow callback blocks the publisher. If you're dispatching to thousands
of subscribers and doing non-trivial work per subscriber, use partitions
(exercise 82) and pass `parallel: true` to fan the dispatch across
scheduler cores.

**6. When NOT to use Registry pubsub**
Cross-node pubsub: use `Phoenix.PubSub` (clustered backends like `PG2`
or Redis) or `:pg`. Durable queues: use RabbitMQ, Kafka, or Broadway.
Registry pubsub is local, in-memory, and ephemeral — perfect for a single
node, wrong for anything else.
