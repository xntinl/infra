# 18. Connection Pool


## Learning Objectives
After completing this exercise, you will be able to:
- **Design** a connection pool using a buffered channel as the backing data structure
- **Implement** acquire/release semantics where goroutines block when the pool is exhausted
- **Observe** contention behavior when many goroutines compete for limited resources
- **Add** health-checking logic that transparently replaces degraded connections


## Why Connection Pooling with Goroutines

Every production service that talks to a database, cache, or external API needs connection pooling. Creating a new connection per request is expensive (TCP handshake, TLS negotiation, authentication), so you maintain a fixed pool of reusable connections. The challenge is that hundreds of request-handling goroutines need to share a small number of connections safely.

A buffered channel is a natural fit for this pattern in Go. The channel's capacity represents the pool size. Acquiring a connection is a channel receive (blocks when empty), and releasing is a channel send (blocks when full, which should never happen in a well-designed pool). The Go runtime handles all the queuing and wake-up logic -- you get a thread-safe pool with zero explicit locking.

This pattern appears in production libraries like `database/sql`'s connection pool, Redis client pools, and HTTP connection pools. Understanding the mechanics here prepares you to reason about pool exhaustion, connection leaks, and health checking in real systems.


## Step 1 -- Basic Pool with Single Goroutine

Start with the simplest possible pool: create it, acquire one connection, use it, release it. This establishes the core data structures and channel-based acquire/release pattern.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

type Connection struct {
	ID        int
	CreatedAt time.Time
	UseCount  int
}

func (c *Connection) Execute(query string) string {
	c.UseCount++
	time.Sleep(50 * time.Millisecond)
	return fmt.Sprintf("[conn-%d] result for: %s (use #%d)", c.ID, query, c.UseCount)
}

type Pool struct {
	connections chan *Connection
	size        int
}

func NewPool(size int) *Pool {
	p := &Pool{
		connections: make(chan *Connection, size),
		size:        size,
	}
	for i := 1; i <= size; i++ {
		p.connections <- &Connection{
			ID:        i,
			CreatedAt: time.Now(),
		}
	}
	return p
}

func (p *Pool) Acquire() *Connection {
	return <-p.connections
}

func (p *Pool) Release(c *Connection) {
	p.connections <- c
}

func (p *Pool) Available() int {
	return len(p.connections)
}

func main() {
	pool := NewPool(5)
	fmt.Printf("Pool created with %d connections\n", pool.size)
	fmt.Printf("Available: %d\n\n", pool.Available())

	conn := pool.Acquire()
	fmt.Printf("Acquired connection %d (available: %d)\n", conn.ID, pool.Available())

	result := conn.Execute("SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10")
	fmt.Printf("Result: %s\n", result)

	pool.Release(conn)
	fmt.Printf("Released connection %d (available: %d)\n", conn.ID, pool.Available())
}
```

**What's happening here:** `NewPool` creates a buffered channel of size 5 and fills it with 5 `Connection` pointers. `Acquire` reads from the channel (blocks if empty), and `Release` writes back to the channel. With a single goroutine, there's no contention -- this just proves the acquire/release cycle works.

**Key insight:** The buffered channel acts as both a storage container and a synchronization primitive. When empty, `Acquire` blocks the calling goroutine until another goroutine calls `Release`. This blocking behavior is exactly what you want -- it naturally throttles concurrent access to the limited resource.

### Intermediate Verification
```bash
go run main.go
```
Expected output:
```
Pool created with 5 connections
Available: 5

Acquired connection 1 (available: 4)
Result: [conn-1] result for: SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10 (use #1)
Released connection 1 (available: 5)
```


## Step 2 -- Concurrent Request Goroutines Competing for Connections

Launch 20 request goroutines that all compete for 5 connections. Observe how goroutines queue up when the pool is exhausted, and how connections are reused across requests.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

type Connection struct {
	ID        int
	CreatedAt time.Time
	UseCount  int
}

func (c *Connection) Execute(query string) string {
	c.UseCount++
	time.Sleep(50 * time.Millisecond)
	return fmt.Sprintf("[conn-%d] %s (use #%d)", c.ID, query, c.UseCount)
}

type Pool struct {
	connections chan *Connection
	size        int
}

func NewPool(size int) *Pool {
	p := &Pool{
		connections: make(chan *Connection, size),
		size:        size,
	}
	for i := 1; i <= size; i++ {
		p.connections <- &Connection{
			ID:        i,
			CreatedAt: time.Now(),
		}
	}
	return p
}

func (p *Pool) Acquire() *Connection {
	return <-p.connections
}

func (p *Pool) Release(c *Connection) {
	p.connections <- c
}

func (p *Pool) Available() int {
	return len(p.connections)
}

const (
	poolSize     = 5
	requestCount = 20
)

func simulateRequest(id int, pool *Pool, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	defer wg.Done()

	waitStart := time.Now()
	conn := pool.Acquire()
	waitTime := time.Since(waitStart)

	result := conn.Execute(fmt.Sprintf("query-%d", id))

	pool.Release(conn)

	fmt.Printf("  req-%02d | waited %6v | %s\n", id, waitTime.Round(time.Millisecond), result)
}

func main() {
	pool := NewPool(poolSize)
	fmt.Printf("Pool: %d connections | Requests: %d\n\n", poolSize, requestCount)

	start := time.Now()
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	for i := 1; i <= requestCount; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go simulateRequest(i, pool, &wg)
	}

	wg.Wait()
	elapsed := time.Since(start)

	fmt.Printf("\n--- Summary ---\n")
	fmt.Printf("  All %d requests completed in %v\n", requestCount, elapsed.Round(time.Millisecond))
	fmt.Printf("  Sequential would have taken: ~%v\n",
		time.Duration(requestCount)*50*time.Millisecond)
	fmt.Printf("  Theoretical minimum (20 reqs / 5 conns): ~%v\n",
		time.Duration(requestCount/poolSize)*50*time.Millisecond)
	fmt.Printf("  Pool available: %d\n", pool.Available())
}
```

**What's happening here:** All 20 goroutines launch nearly simultaneously. The first 5 acquire connections immediately. The remaining 15 block on `pool.Acquire()` until a connection is released. As each connection is released after its 50ms query, the next waiting goroutine wakes up and acquires it. The pool acts as a natural throttle, allowing at most 5 concurrent database operations.

**Key insight:** The `waitTime` measurement shows the queuing effect. Early goroutines wait ~0ms (connections available immediately). Later goroutines wait 50-200ms as they queue behind others. This is the same queuing behavior you'd see in a real database connection pool under load.

### Intermediate Verification
```bash
go run main.go
```
Expected output (order varies):
```
Pool: 5 connections | Requests: 20

  req-03 | waited    0ms | [conn-3] query-3 (use #1)
  req-01 | waited    0ms | [conn-1] query-1 (use #1)
  req-05 | waited    0ms | [conn-5] query-5 (use #1)
  req-02 | waited    0ms | [conn-2] query-2 (use #1)
  req-04 | waited    0ms | [conn-4] query-4 (use #1)
  req-08 | waited   50ms | [conn-3] query-8 (use #2)
  req-06 | waited   50ms | [conn-1] query-6 (use #2)
  req-10 | waited   50ms | [conn-5] query-10 (use #2)
  req-07 | waited   50ms | [conn-2] query-7 (use #2)
  req-09 | waited   51ms | [conn-4] query-9 (use #2)
  ...
  req-20 | waited  151ms | [conn-2] query-20 (use #4)

--- Summary ---
  All 20 requests completed in 200ms
  Sequential would have taken: ~1s
  Theoretical minimum (20 reqs / 5 conns): ~200ms
  Pool available: 5
```


## Step 3 -- Timing Analysis of Pool Contention

Add detailed timing to visualize exactly when each goroutine acquires and releases its connection. This reveals the wave pattern of pool utilization.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sort"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

type Connection struct {
	ID        int
	CreatedAt time.Time
	UseCount  int
}

func (c *Connection) Execute(query string) string {
	c.UseCount++
	time.Sleep(50 * time.Millisecond)
	return fmt.Sprintf("conn-%d use #%d", c.ID, c.UseCount)
}

type Pool struct {
	connections chan *Connection
	size        int
}

func NewPool(size int) *Pool {
	p := &Pool{
		connections: make(chan *Connection, size),
		size:        size,
	}
	for i := 1; i <= size; i++ {
		p.connections <- &Connection{
			ID:        i,
			CreatedAt: time.Now(),
		}
	}
	return p
}

func (p *Pool) Acquire() *Connection { return <-p.connections }
func (p *Pool) Release(c *Connection) { p.connections <- c }

const (
	poolSize     = 5
	requestCount = 20
)

type RequestLog struct {
	RequestID  int
	ConnID     int
	WaitTime   time.Duration
	AcquireAt  time.Duration
	ReleaseAt  time.Duration
}

func main() {
	pool := NewPool(poolSize)
	origin := time.Now()

	logs := make(chan RequestLog, requestCount)
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	for i := 1; i <= requestCount; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go func(reqID int) {
			defer wg.Done()

			waitStart := time.Now()
			conn := pool.Acquire()
			acquireAt := time.Since(origin)
			waitTime := time.Since(waitStart)

			conn.Execute(fmt.Sprintf("query-%d", reqID))

			pool.Release(conn)
			releaseAt := time.Since(origin)

			logs <- RequestLog{
				RequestID: reqID,
				ConnID:    conn.ID,
				WaitTime:  waitTime,
				AcquireAt: acquireAt,
				ReleaseAt: releaseAt,
			}
		}(i)
	}

	wg.Wait()
	close(logs)

	var allLogs []RequestLog
	for l := range logs {
		allLogs = append(allLogs, l)
	}

	sort.Slice(allLogs, func(i, j int) bool {
		return allLogs[i].AcquireAt < allLogs[j].AcquireAt
	})

	fmt.Printf("=== Pool Contention Timeline (%d pool / %d requests) ===\n\n", poolSize, requestCount)
	fmt.Printf("  %-6s %-7s %10s %10s %10s\n", "Req", "Conn", "Waited", "Acquired", "Released")
	fmt.Printf("  %-6s %-7s %10s %10s %10s\n", "---", "----", "------", "--------", "--------")

	for _, l := range allLogs {
		fmt.Printf("  req-%02d conn-%d %10v %10v %10v\n",
			l.RequestID, l.ConnID,
			l.WaitTime.Round(time.Millisecond),
			l.AcquireAt.Round(time.Millisecond),
			l.ReleaseAt.Round(time.Millisecond))
	}

	connUsage := make(map[int]int)
	var maxWait time.Duration
	for _, l := range allLogs {
		connUsage[l.ConnID]++
		if l.WaitTime > maxWait {
			maxWait = l.WaitTime
		}
	}

	fmt.Printf("\n--- Connection Utilization ---\n")
	for id := 1; id <= poolSize; id++ {
		bar := ""
		for j := 0; j < connUsage[id]; j++ {
			bar += "##"
		}
		fmt.Printf("  conn-%d: %d uses %s\n", id, connUsage[id], bar)
	}

	fmt.Printf("\n--- Contention Stats ---\n")
	fmt.Printf("  Max wait time: %v\n", maxWait.Round(time.Millisecond))
	fmt.Printf("  Total elapsed:  %v\n", allLogs[len(allLogs)-1].ReleaseAt.Round(time.Millisecond))
	fmt.Printf("  Waves: %d (20 requests / 5 connections)\n", requestCount/poolSize)
}
```

**What's happening here:** Each goroutine records when it acquired and released its connection relative to the program start. Sorting by acquire time reveals the wave pattern: requests 1-5 acquire at ~0ms, requests 6-10 at ~50ms (when the first wave releases), requests 11-15 at ~100ms, and requests 16-20 at ~150ms. The connection utilization shows that each connection serves exactly 4 requests (20 / 5).

**Key insight:** The timeline makes the contention model concrete. Pool-based concurrency is not about running everything at once -- it is about controlling how many things run simultaneously. This is the same throttling model used by `database/sql.SetMaxOpenConns()`, HTTP client pools, and worker pool patterns.

### Intermediate Verification
```bash
go run main.go
```
Expected output (IDs and exact times vary):
```
=== Pool Contention Timeline (5 pool / 20 requests) ===

  Req    Conn        Waited   Acquired   Released
  ---    ----        ------   --------   --------

  req-05 conn-5        0ms        0ms       50ms
  req-03 conn-3        0ms        0ms       50ms
  req-01 conn-1        0ms        0ms       50ms
  req-04 conn-4        0ms        0ms       50ms

  req-16 conn-1      150ms      150ms      200ms
  req-20 conn-4      150ms      150ms      200ms

  conn-5: 4 uses ########

--- Contention Stats ---
  Max wait time: 150ms
  Total elapsed:  200ms
  Waves: 4 (20 requests / 5 connections)
```


## Step 4 -- Health Checking and Connection Replacement

Add a maximum use count per connection. When a connection has been used too many times, replace it with a fresh one before returning it to the pool. This simulates production connection pools that retire stale connections.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"sync/atomic"
	"time"
)

const (
	poolSize       = 5
	requestCount   = 20
	maxUsePerConn  = 3
)

var nextConnID int64

type Connection struct {
	ID        int
	CreatedAt time.Time
	UseCount  int
}

func newConnection() *Connection {
	id := int(atomic.AddInt64(&nextConnID, 1))
	return &Connection{
		ID:        id,
		CreatedAt: time.Now(),
	}
}

func (c *Connection) Execute(query string) string {
	c.UseCount++
	time.Sleep(50 * time.Millisecond)
	return fmt.Sprintf("conn-%d use #%d", c.ID, c.UseCount)
}

func (c *Connection) IsHealthy() bool {
	return c.UseCount < maxUsePerConn
}

type Pool struct {
	connections chan *Connection
	size        int
	replaced    int64
}

func NewPool(size int) *Pool {
	p := &Pool{
		connections: make(chan *Connection, size),
		size:        size,
	}
	for i := 0; i < size; i++ {
		p.connections <- newConnection()
	}
	return p
}

func (p *Pool) Acquire() *Connection {
	return <-p.connections
}

func (p *Pool) Release(c *Connection) {
	if !c.IsHealthy() {
		atomic.AddInt64(&p.replaced, 1)
		fresh := newConnection()
		fmt.Printf("    [pool] conn-%d retired after %d uses, replaced with conn-%d\n",
			c.ID, c.UseCount, fresh.ID)
		p.connections <- fresh
		return
	}
	p.connections <- c
}

func (p *Pool) Replaced() int64 {
	return atomic.LoadInt64(&p.replaced)
}

type RequestResult struct {
	RequestID int
	ConnID    int
	ConnUse   int
	WaitTime  time.Duration
}

func main() {
	pool := NewPool(poolSize)
	fmt.Printf("Pool: %d connections | Max uses per conn: %d | Requests: %d\n\n",
		poolSize, maxUsePerConn, requestCount)

	results := make(chan RequestResult, requestCount)
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	start := time.Now()

	for i := 1; i <= requestCount; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go func(reqID int) {
			defer wg.Done()

			waitStart := time.Now()
			conn := pool.Acquire()
			waitTime := time.Since(waitStart)

			conn.Execute(fmt.Sprintf("query-%d", reqID))

			connID := conn.ID
			connUse := conn.UseCount

			pool.Release(conn)

			results <- RequestResult{
				RequestID: reqID,
				ConnID:    connID,
				ConnUse:   connUse,
				WaitTime:  waitTime,
			}
		}(i)
	}

	wg.Wait()
	close(results)
	elapsed := time.Since(start)

	var allResults []RequestResult
	for r := range results {
		allResults = append(allResults, r)
	}

	fmt.Printf("\n--- Results ---\n")
	fmt.Printf("  %-6s %-8s %-8s %s\n", "Req", "Conn", "ConnUse", "Wait")
	for _, r := range allResults {
		fmt.Printf("  req-%02d conn-%-3d use %-3d %v\n",
			r.RequestID, r.ConnID, r.ConnUse, r.WaitTime.Round(time.Millisecond))
	}

	fmt.Printf("\n--- Health Check Summary ---\n")
	fmt.Printf("  Total requests:       %d\n", requestCount)
	fmt.Printf("  Connections replaced:  %d\n", pool.Replaced())
	fmt.Printf("  Total elapsed:         %v\n", elapsed.Round(time.Millisecond))
	fmt.Printf("  Unique connection IDs: original 1-%d, new ones created on replacement\n", poolSize)
}
```

**What's happening here:** Each connection tracks its use count. When `Release` is called, the pool checks `IsHealthy()`. If the connection has reached `maxUsePerConn` (3), it is discarded and replaced with a fresh one. The `atomic.AddInt64` for `nextConnID` ensures unique IDs even when replacements happen concurrently. You'll see connection IDs above 5 appear as old connections are retired.

**Key insight:** The health check happens at release time, not acquire time. This is a deliberate design choice: the goroutine that just used the connection pays the replacement cost, rather than the next goroutine that needs a connection. In production, you might also check connection health at acquire time (e.g., ping the database), but release-time checks for usage limits are cheaper and predictable.

### Intermediate Verification
```bash
go run main.go
```
Expected output (order and IDs vary):
```
Pool: 5 connections | Max uses per conn: 3 | Requests: 20

    [pool] conn-1 retired after 3 uses, replaced with conn-6
    [pool] conn-3 retired after 3 uses, replaced with conn-7
    [pool] conn-2 retired after 3 uses, replaced with conn-8
    [pool] conn-5 retired after 3 uses, replaced with conn-9
    [pool] conn-4 retired after 3 uses, replaced with conn-10
    [pool] conn-6 retired after 3 uses, replaced with conn-11
    [pool] conn-7 retired after 3 uses, replaced with conn-12

--- Results ---

  ...

```


## Common Mistakes

### Forgetting to Release Connections (Connection Leak)

**Wrong -- complete program:**
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

type Connection struct{ ID int }

func main() {
	pool := make(chan *Connection, 3)
	for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
		pool <- &Connection{ID: i}
	}

	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go func(reqID int) {
			defer wg.Done()
			conn := <-pool
			fmt.Printf("req-%d acquired conn-%d\n", reqID, conn.ID)
			time.Sleep(50 * time.Millisecond)
			// BUG: never releases connection back to pool
		}(i)
	}
	wg.Wait() // deadlock: requests 3 and 4 wait forever for a connection
}
```
**What happens:** The first 3 goroutines acquire connections but never release them. Goroutines 3 and 4 block forever on `<-pool`. This is a connection leak -- the most common pool-related bug in production. The `wg.Wait()` deadlocks because goroutines 3 and 4 never finish.

**Correct -- always release with defer:**
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

type Connection struct{ ID int }

func main() {
	pool := make(chan *Connection, 3)
	for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
		pool <- &Connection{ID: i}
	}

	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go func(reqID int) {
			defer wg.Done()
			conn := <-pool
			defer func() { pool <- conn }() // always release

			fmt.Printf("req-%d acquired conn-%d\n", reqID, conn.ID)
			time.Sleep(50 * time.Millisecond)
		}(i)
	}
	wg.Wait()
	fmt.Printf("Pool available: %d\n", len(pool))
}
```

### Releasing a Connection Twice

**Wrong -- complete program:**
```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Connection struct{ ID int }

func main() {
	pool := make(chan *Connection, 2)
	pool <- &Connection{ID: 1}
	pool <- &Connection{ID: 2}

	conn := <-pool
	fmt.Printf("Acquired conn-%d (available: %d)\n", conn.ID, len(pool))
	pool <- conn // release once
	pool <- conn // release again -- pool now has 3 items in a size-2 channel!
	// This blocks forever because the channel is full
}
```
**What happens:** Releasing twice either blocks (if channel is full) or corrupts the pool by having duplicate references. Two goroutines could acquire the "same" connection simultaneously, causing data corruption.

**Correct -- ensure single release per acquire:**
```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Connection struct{ ID int }

type Pool struct {
	conns chan *Connection
}

func (p *Pool) Acquire() *Connection { return <-p.conns }
func (p *Pool) Release(c *Connection) { p.conns <- c }

func main() {
	p := &Pool{conns: make(chan *Connection, 2)}
	p.conns <- &Connection{ID: 1}
	p.conns <- &Connection{ID: 2}

	conn := p.Acquire()
	fmt.Printf("Acquired conn-%d (available: %d)\n", conn.ID, len(p.conns))
	// Use the connection...
	p.Release(conn) // exactly one release per acquire
	fmt.Printf("Released conn-%d (available: %d)\n", conn.ID, len(p.conns))
}
```


## Verify What You Learned

Build a "rate-limited API client" that:
1. Creates a pool of 3 API client connections, each with a unique client ID
2. Launches 15 goroutines, each making an "API call" that takes 100ms
3. Each goroutine acquires a client, makes the call, and releases the client
4. Tracks per-client usage count and per-request wait time
5. After all requests complete, prints a timeline showing 5 waves of 3 concurrent requests
6. Adds a maximum-uses-per-client limit of 4, replacing clients that exceed the limit

**Hint:** Use `defer` to guarantee connection release even if the simulated API call panics. Track the timeline using `time.Since(origin)` at acquire and release points.


## What's Next
Continue to [19-parallel-validation](../19-parallel-validation/19-parallel-validation.md) to run independent validation checks concurrently with structured result collection.


## Summary
- A buffered channel naturally implements a fixed-size pool: capacity = pool size
- Acquire is a channel receive (blocks when pool is empty); release is a channel send
- The pool automatically queues goroutines when all connections are in use -- no explicit locking
- Always release connections, preferably with `defer`, to prevent pool exhaustion
- Health checking at release time lets you retire degraded connections transparently
- The wave pattern (N concurrent, then wait, then N more) is the visible effect of pool-based throttling
