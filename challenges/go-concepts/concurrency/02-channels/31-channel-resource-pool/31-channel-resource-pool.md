# 31. Channel-Based Resource Pool with Health Checks

## Learning Objectives
After completing this exercise, you will be able to:
- **Build** a connection pool managed entirely through channels with acquire and release operations
- **Implement** a waiter queue that parks callers when all connections are in use
- **Add** periodic health checks that validate idle connections and evict dead ones
- **Replace** failed connections transparently so the pool maintains its target size

## Why Channel-Based Resource Pools

Every database-backed application needs connection pooling. Opening a new connection per request is too slow (TCP handshake, TLS, authentication). Keeping too many connections open wastes server resources. The pool must manage a fixed set of connections: hand them out on demand, take them back when done, and ensure they are still alive.

The traditional approach uses a mutex-protected list of connections with condition variables for waiters. This works but is error-prone: forgotten unlocks, deadlocks under complex conditions, condition variable broadcast storms.

A channel-based pool uses a single manager goroutine that owns all connections. Callers request a connection by sending on an acquire channel and waiting on a per-request reply channel. They return connections on a release channel. A ticker triggers periodic health checks on idle connections. The manager evicts dead connections and creates replacements. All state lives in one goroutine, all communication is through channels. No mutex, no condition variable, no data races by construction.

## Step 1 -- Basic Acquire and Release

Build the core pool: a manager goroutine that holds N connections. Callers acquire by sending a request, receive a connection on their reply channel, and release when done.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"sync/atomic"
	"time"
)

const poolSize = 3

var connIDCounter atomic.Int64

// Conn simulates a database connection.
type Conn struct {
	ID        int64
	CreatedAt time.Time
}

// NewConn creates a simulated connection.
func NewConn() *Conn {
	id := connIDCounter.Add(1)
	return &Conn{ID: id, CreatedAt: time.Now()}
}

// AcquireRequest asks the pool for a connection.
type AcquireRequest struct {
	Reply chan *Conn
}

// NewAcquireRequest creates a request with an initialized reply channel.
func NewAcquireRequest() AcquireRequest {
	return AcquireRequest{Reply: make(chan *Conn, 1)}
}

// poolManager owns all connections and handles acquire/release.
func poolManager(acquire <-chan AcquireRequest, release <-chan *Conn, done <-chan struct{}) {
	idle := make([]*Conn, 0, poolSize)
	for i := 0; i < poolSize; i++ {
		idle = append(idle, NewConn())
	}
	fmt.Printf("[pool] initialized with %d connections\n", len(idle))

	for {
		select {
		case <-done:
			fmt.Printf("[pool] shutting down, %d idle connections\n", len(idle))
			return

		case req := <-acquire:
			if len(idle) > 0 {
				conn := idle[len(idle)-1]
				idle = idle[:len(idle)-1]
				req.Reply <- conn
			} else {
				req.Reply <- nil
			}

		case conn := <-release:
			idle = append(idle, conn)
		}
	}
}

func main() {
	acquire := make(chan AcquireRequest, 10)
	release := make(chan *Conn, 10)
	done := make(chan struct{})

	go poolManager(acquire, release, done)

	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go func(workerID int) {
			defer wg.Done()
			req := NewAcquireRequest()
			acquire <- req
			conn := <-req.Reply
			if conn == nil {
				fmt.Printf("  worker %d: no connection available\n", workerID)
				return
			}
			fmt.Printf("  worker %d: acquired conn %d\n", workerID, conn.ID)
			time.Sleep(50 * time.Millisecond)
			release <- conn
			fmt.Printf("  worker %d: released conn %d\n", workerID, conn.ID)
		}(i)
	}

	wg.Wait()
	close(done)
}
```

Key observations:
- The pool starts with 3 connections. Workers 1-3 get a connection, workers 4-5 get `nil` (pool exhausted)
- The idle slice acts as a LIFO stack -- most recently released connections are reused first (better for cache locality)
- The manager goroutine is the sole owner of the idle list -- no concurrent access

### Intermediate Verification
```bash
go run main.go
```
Expected output (order may vary):
```
[pool] initialized with 3 connections
  worker 1: acquired conn 3
  worker 2: acquired conn 2
  worker 3: acquired conn 1
  worker 4: no connection available
  worker 5: no connection available
  worker 1: released conn 3
  worker 2: released conn 2
  worker 3: released conn 1
[pool] shutting down, 3 idle connections
```

## Step 2 -- Waiter Queue for Pool Exhaustion

Instead of returning nil when the pool is exhausted, queue the caller and serve it when a connection is released.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"sync/atomic"
	"time"
)

const waiterPoolSize = 3

var waiterConnID atomic.Int64

type Conn struct {
	ID        int64
	CreatedAt time.Time
}

func NewConn() *Conn {
	return &Conn{ID: waiterConnID.Add(1), CreatedAt: time.Now()}
}

type AcquireRequest struct {
	Reply chan *Conn
}

func NewAcquireRequest() AcquireRequest {
	return AcquireRequest{Reply: make(chan *Conn, 1)}
}

// poolManagerWithWaiters queues callers when no connections are available.
func poolManagerWithWaiters(acquire <-chan AcquireRequest, release <-chan *Conn, done <-chan struct{}) {
	idle := make([]*Conn, 0, waiterPoolSize)
	for i := 0; i < waiterPoolSize; i++ {
		idle = append(idle, NewConn())
	}

	waiters := make([]AcquireRequest, 0)

	for {
		select {
		case <-done:
			// Unblock any remaining waiters with nil.
			for _, w := range waiters {
				w.Reply <- nil
			}
			return

		case req := <-acquire:
			if len(idle) > 0 {
				conn := idle[len(idle)-1]
				idle = idle[:len(idle)-1]
				req.Reply <- conn
			} else {
				waiters = append(waiters, req)
				fmt.Printf("[pool] no idle conns, queued waiter (queue: %d)\n", len(waiters))
			}

		case conn := <-release:
			if len(waiters) > 0 {
				next := waiters[0]
				waiters = waiters[1:]
				next.Reply <- conn
				fmt.Printf("[pool] served queued waiter (queue: %d)\n", len(waiters))
			} else {
				idle = append(idle, conn)
			}
		}
	}
}

func main() {
	acquire := make(chan AcquireRequest, 10)
	release := make(chan *Conn, 10)
	done := make(chan struct{})

	go poolManagerWithWaiters(acquire, release, done)

	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	epoch := time.Now()

	for i := 1; i <= 6; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go func(workerID int) {
			defer wg.Done()
			start := time.Now()
			req := NewAcquireRequest()
			acquire <- req
			conn := <-req.Reply
			if conn == nil {
				fmt.Printf("  worker %d: pool shut down\n", workerID)
				return
			}
			waitTime := time.Since(start).Round(time.Millisecond)
			fmt.Printf("  worker %d: acquired conn %d (waited %v)\n",
				workerID, conn.ID, waitTime)
			time.Sleep(80 * time.Millisecond)
			release <- conn
			fmt.Printf("  worker %d: released conn %d\n", workerID, conn.ID)
		}(i)
	}

	wg.Wait()
	close(done)
	elapsed := time.Since(epoch).Round(time.Millisecond)
	fmt.Printf("\ntotal time: %v (pool size: %d, workers: 6)\n", elapsed, waiterPoolSize)
}
```

With 6 workers and 3 connections:
- Workers 1-3 acquire immediately (wait ~0ms)
- Workers 4-6 are queued and served as connections are released (wait ~80ms)
- Total time is ~160ms (two rounds of 3 workers), not ~480ms (6 sequential)

### Intermediate Verification
```bash
go run -race main.go
```
Expected output (approximate):
```
[pool] no idle conns, queued waiter (queue: 1)
[pool] no idle conns, queued waiter (queue: 2)
[pool] no idle conns, queued waiter (queue: 3)
  worker 1: acquired conn 3 (waited 0s)
  worker 2: acquired conn 2 (waited 0s)
  worker 3: acquired conn 1 (waited 0s)
  worker 1: released conn 3
[pool] served queued waiter (queue: 2)
  worker 4: acquired conn 3 (waited 80ms)
  worker 2: released conn 2
[pool] served queued waiter (queue: 1)
  worker 5: acquired conn 2 (waited 80ms)
  worker 3: released conn 1
[pool] served queued waiter (queue: 0)
  worker 6: acquired conn 1 (waited 80ms)
  worker 4: released conn 3
  worker 5: released conn 2
  worker 6: released conn 1

total time: 160ms (pool size: 3, workers: 6)
```

## Step 3 -- Health-Check Ticker for Idle Connections

Add a periodic health check that validates idle connections. Dead connections are evicted and replaced with fresh ones.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"sync/atomic"
	"time"
)

const (
	healthPoolSize    = 4
	healthCheckPeriod = 100 * time.Millisecond
	connMaxAge        = 250 * time.Millisecond
)

var healthConnID atomic.Int64

type Conn struct {
	ID        int64
	CreatedAt time.Time
	healthy   bool
}

func NewConn() *Conn {
	return &Conn{
		ID:        healthConnID.Add(1),
		CreatedAt: time.Now(),
		healthy:   true,
	}
}

// IsHealthy checks if the connection is still usable.
// Simulates failure: connections older than connMaxAge are considered dead.
func (c *Conn) IsHealthy() bool {
	return c.healthy && time.Since(c.CreatedAt) < connMaxAge
}

type AcquireRequest struct {
	Reply chan *Conn
}

func NewAcquireRequest() AcquireRequest {
	return AcquireRequest{Reply: make(chan *Conn, 1)}
}

// healthCheckPool runs health checks on idle connections when the ticker fires.
func healthCheckPool(
	acquire <-chan AcquireRequest,
	release <-chan *Conn,
	done <-chan struct{},
	healthTick <-chan time.Time,
) {
	idle := make([]*Conn, 0, healthPoolSize)
	for i := 0; i < healthPoolSize; i++ {
		idle = append(idle, NewConn())
	}
	fmt.Printf("[pool] initialized: %d connections\n", healthPoolSize)

	totalCreated := healthPoolSize
	totalEvicted := 0
	waiters := make([]AcquireRequest, 0)

	for {
		select {
		case <-done:
			for _, w := range waiters {
				w.Reply <- nil
			}
			fmt.Printf("[pool] shutdown: created=%d, evicted=%d\n", totalCreated, totalEvicted)
			return

		case req := <-acquire:
			if len(idle) > 0 {
				conn := idle[len(idle)-1]
				idle = idle[:len(idle)-1]
				req.Reply <- conn
			} else {
				waiters = append(waiters, req)
			}

		case conn := <-release:
			if len(waiters) > 0 {
				next := waiters[0]
				waiters = waiters[1:]
				next.Reply <- conn
			} else {
				idle = append(idle, conn)
			}

		case <-healthTick:
			healthy := make([]*Conn, 0, len(idle))
			evicted := 0
			for _, conn := range idle {
				if conn.IsHealthy() {
					healthy = append(healthy, conn)
				} else {
					evicted++
					totalEvicted++
					fmt.Printf("[health] evicted conn %d (age: %v)\n",
						conn.ID, time.Since(conn.CreatedAt).Round(time.Millisecond))
				}
			}
			// Replace evicted connections.
			for i := 0; i < evicted; i++ {
				replacement := NewConn()
				totalCreated++
				healthy = append(healthy, replacement)
				fmt.Printf("[health] created replacement conn %d\n", replacement.ID)
			}
			idle = healthy
			fmt.Printf("[health] check complete: %d idle, %d evicted\n", len(idle), evicted)
		}
	}
}

func main() {
	acquire := make(chan AcquireRequest, 10)
	release := make(chan *Conn, 10)
	done := make(chan struct{})
	ticker := time.NewTicker(healthCheckPeriod)
	defer ticker.Stop()

	go healthCheckPool(acquire, release, done, ticker.C)

	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	// Phase 1: use connections normally.
	fmt.Println("=== Phase 1: normal usage ===")
	for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go func(id int) {
			defer wg.Done()
			req := NewAcquireRequest()
			acquire <- req
			conn := <-req.Reply
			if conn == nil {
				return
			}
			fmt.Printf("  worker %d: using conn %d\n", id, conn.ID)
			time.Sleep(40 * time.Millisecond)
			release <- conn
		}(i)
	}
	wg.Wait()

	// Phase 2: wait for health checks to evict old connections.
	fmt.Println()
	fmt.Println("=== Phase 2: waiting for health checks ===")
	time.Sleep(350 * time.Millisecond)

	// Phase 3: use connections again (should get replacement connections).
	fmt.Println()
	fmt.Println("=== Phase 3: using replacement connections ===")
	for i := 4; i <= 6; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go func(id int) {
			defer wg.Done()
			req := NewAcquireRequest()
			acquire <- req
			conn := <-req.Reply
			if conn == nil {
				return
			}
			fmt.Printf("  worker %d: using conn %d (created: %v ago)\n",
				id, conn.ID, time.Since(conn.CreatedAt).Round(time.Millisecond))
			time.Sleep(30 * time.Millisecond)
			release <- conn
		}(i)
	}
	wg.Wait()

	close(done)
}
```

During Phase 2, the ticker fires and the health check evicts connections older than 250ms. Replacement connections are created. In Phase 3, workers get the fresh replacement connections.

### Intermediate Verification
```bash
go run -race main.go
```
Expected output (approximate):
```
[pool] initialized: 4 connections
=== Phase 1: normal usage ===
  worker 1: using conn 4
  worker 2: using conn 3
  worker 3: using conn 2
[health] check complete: 4 idle, 0 evicted

=== Phase 2: waiting for health checks ===
[health] evicted conn 1 (age: 300ms)
[health] evicted conn 2 (age: 300ms)
[health] evicted conn 3 (age: 300ms)
[health] evicted conn 4 (age: 300ms)
[health] created replacement conn 5
[health] created replacement conn 6
[health] created replacement conn 7
[health] created replacement conn 8
[health] check complete: 4 idle, 4 evicted

=== Phase 3: using replacement connections ===
  worker 4: using conn 8 (created: 10ms ago)
  worker 5: using conn 7 (created: 10ms ago)
  worker 6: using conn 6 (created: 10ms ago)
[pool] shutdown: created=8, evicted=4
```

## Step 4 -- Connection Replacement on Failure

Handle the case where a connection fails during use. The worker reports a bad connection on a separate channel, and the pool replaces it without the worker needing to retry manually.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand/v2"
	"sync"
	"sync/atomic"
	"time"
)

const (
	fullPoolSize          = 3
	fullHealthPeriod      = 150 * time.Millisecond
	fullConnMaxAge        = 500 * time.Millisecond
	failureProbability    = 30
	fullWorkerCount       = 10
)

var fullConnID atomic.Int64

type Conn struct {
	ID        int64
	CreatedAt time.Time
}

func NewConn() *Conn {
	return &Conn{ID: fullConnID.Add(1), CreatedAt: time.Now()}
}

func (c *Conn) IsHealthy() bool {
	return time.Since(c.CreatedAt) < fullConnMaxAge
}

type AcquireRequest struct {
	Reply chan *Conn
}

func NewAcquireRequest() AcquireRequest {
	return AcquireRequest{Reply: make(chan *Conn, 1)}
}

// BadConnReport signals that a connection failed during use.
type BadConnReport struct {
	ConnID int64
	Reply  chan *Conn
}

// fullPoolManager handles acquire, release, bad connections, and health checks.
func fullPoolManager(
	acquire <-chan AcquireRequest,
	release <-chan *Conn,
	badConn <-chan BadConnReport,
	done <-chan struct{},
	healthTick <-chan time.Time,
) {
	idle := make([]*Conn, 0, fullPoolSize)
	for i := 0; i < fullPoolSize; i++ {
		idle = append(idle, NewConn())
	}

	waiters := make([]AcquireRequest, 0)
	stats := struct {
		created, evicted, badReports int
	}{created: fullPoolSize}

	serveOrQueue := func(req AcquireRequest) {
		if len(idle) > 0 {
			conn := idle[len(idle)-1]
			idle = idle[:len(idle)-1]
			req.Reply <- conn
		} else {
			waiters = append(waiters, req)
		}
	}

	returnToPool := func(conn *Conn) {
		if len(waiters) > 0 {
			next := waiters[0]
			waiters = waiters[1:]
			next.Reply <- conn
		} else {
			idle = append(idle, conn)
		}
	}

	for {
		select {
		case <-done:
			for _, w := range waiters {
				w.Reply <- nil
			}
			fmt.Printf("[pool] shutdown: created=%d, evicted=%d, bad_reports=%d\n",
				stats.created, stats.evicted, stats.badReports)
			return

		case req := <-acquire:
			serveOrQueue(req)

		case conn := <-release:
			returnToPool(conn)

		case report := <-badConn:
			stats.badReports++
			replacement := NewConn()
			stats.created++
			fmt.Printf("[pool] bad conn %d replaced with conn %d\n",
				report.ConnID, replacement.ID)
			report.Reply <- replacement

		case <-healthTick:
			healthy := make([]*Conn, 0, len(idle))
			for _, conn := range idle {
				if conn.IsHealthy() {
					healthy = append(healthy, conn)
				} else {
					stats.evicted++
					replacement := NewConn()
					stats.created++
					healthy = append(healthy, replacement)
				}
			}
			idle = healthy
		}
	}
}

func main() {
	acquire := make(chan AcquireRequest, 20)
	release := make(chan *Conn, 20)
	badConn := make(chan BadConnReport, 10)
	done := make(chan struct{})
	ticker := time.NewTicker(fullHealthPeriod)
	defer ticker.Stop()

	go fullPoolManager(acquire, release, badConn, done, ticker.C)

	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	rng := rand.New(rand.NewPCG(42, 0))

	successCount := 0
	failCount := 0
	var mu sync.Mutex

	for i := 1; i <= fullWorkerCount; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		willFail := rng.Intn(100) < failureProbability
		go func(workerID int, simulateFail bool) {
			defer wg.Done()
			req := NewAcquireRequest()
			acquire <- req
			conn := <-req.Reply
			if conn == nil {
				return
			}

			time.Sleep(30 * time.Millisecond)

			if simulateFail {
				fmt.Printf("  worker %d: conn %d failed during query\n", workerID, conn.ID)
				report := BadConnReport{ConnID: conn.ID, Reply: make(chan *Conn, 1)}
				badConn <- report
				replacement := <-report.Reply
				fmt.Printf("  worker %d: got replacement conn %d\n", workerID, replacement.ID)
				time.Sleep(20 * time.Millisecond)
				release <- replacement
				mu.Lock()
				failCount++
				mu.Unlock()
			} else {
				release <- conn
				mu.Lock()
				successCount++
				mu.Unlock()
			}
			fmt.Printf("  worker %d: done\n", workerID)
		}(i, willFail)
	}

	wg.Wait()
	close(done)

	fmt.Printf("\n=== Results ===\n")
	fmt.Printf("  workers: %d, success: %d, recovered: %d\n",
		fullWorkerCount, successCount, failCount)
}
```

When a connection fails, the worker does not release it (it is dead). Instead, it sends a `BadConnReport`. The pool creates a replacement and sends it back on the report's reply channel. The worker continues with the replacement connection.

### Intermediate Verification
```bash
go run -race main.go
```
Expected output (approximate, depends on RNG seed):
```
  worker 1: conn 3 failed during query
[pool] bad conn 3 replaced with conn 4
  worker 1: got replacement conn 4
  worker 2: done
  worker 3: done
  ...
  worker 10: done

=== Results ===
  workers: 10, success: 7, recovered: 3
[pool] shutdown: created=6, evicted=0, bad_reports=3
```

## Common Mistakes

### Returning Dead Connections to the Pool
**What happens:** If a worker detects a connection failure but still releases it to the pool via the release channel, the next worker that acquires it will also fail. The dead connection bounces between workers.

**Fix:** Use a separate `badConn` channel for failed connections. The pool manager replaces them instead of putting them back in the idle list.

### Forgetting to Unblock Waiters on Shutdown
**What happens:** When the pool manager exits without sending to queued waiters' reply channels, those goroutines block on `<-req.Reply` forever, leaking goroutines.

**Fix:** On shutdown, iterate over all waiters and send nil to their reply channels:
```go
case <-done:
    for _, w := range waiters {
        w.Reply <- nil
    }
    return
```

### Health Check Running While Connections Are In Use
**What happens:** The health check only examines the idle list. Connections currently in use by workers are not in the idle list, so they are not checked. This is correct behavior -- but a common misunderstanding is to try to check all connections, which would require tracking checked-out connections and introduces complexity.

**Fix:** Health checks only validate idle connections. If a connection fails during use, the worker reports it via the `badConn` channel. This separation keeps the manager simple.

## Verify What You Learned
1. Add an acquire timeout: if no connection becomes available within 200ms, the acquire request should receive nil and the waiter should be removed from the queue.
2. Implement pool metrics: track average wait time, utilization rate (in-use vs idle), and the total number of health check evictions over the pool's lifetime.

## What's Next
Continue to [32. Channel-Based Request Coalescing (Singleflight)](../32-channel-request-coalescing/32-channel-request-coalescing.md) to learn how a central goroutine can deduplicate concurrent requests for the same resource, preventing thundering herd problems.

## Summary
- A channel-based resource pool uses a single manager goroutine that owns all connection state
- Acquire and release happen through dedicated channels with per-request reply channels
- A waiter queue parks callers when the pool is exhausted and serves them FIFO on release
- A `time.Ticker` triggers periodic health checks on idle connections
- Dead connections are evicted and replaced to maintain the pool's target size
- A separate bad-connection channel handles in-use failures without polluting the idle pool
- The manager goroutine's `select` loop handles all events (acquire, release, health, bad conn, shutdown) concurrently
