# 24. Channel-Based Retry with Exponential Backoff

## Learning Objectives
After completing this exercise, you will be able to:
- **Build** a retry goroutine that receives failed operations on an input channel and re-submits them on an output channel
- **Implement** exponential backoff with jitter using `time.Timer` instead of `time.Sleep`
- **Route** permanently failed operations to a dead-letter channel after max retries
- **Compose** multiple concurrent retry loops as a reusable pipeline stage

## Why Channel-Based Retry

Every production service calls external APIs that fail transiently. A database returns "too many connections." A cloud provider returns 503 for 2 seconds during a deployment. A payment gateway times out under load. The naive approach is to wrap every call site with retry logic -- but this scatters retry policy across the entire codebase, mixes it with business logic, and makes it impossible to change consistently.

The channel-based approach extracts retry into a standalone pipeline stage. Failed operations flow into a retry channel. A retry goroutine owns the backoff timer, the attempt counter, and the max-retry policy. Successful retries flow out to a results channel. Permanently failed operations flow to a dead-letter channel for alerting or manual review. Business logic never sees retry -- it sends an operation and receives either a result or a dead-letter notification.

This separation makes retry policy testable in isolation, swappable at runtime, and consistent across every call site. The same pattern works for HTTP retries, message queue redelivery, and distributed task execution.

## Step 1 -- Single Retry with Fixed Delay

Start with the simplest case: one operation fails, gets retried once after a fixed delay, and succeeds.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

const fixedDelay = 200 * time.Millisecond

// Operation represents a unit of work that may need retrying.
type Operation struct {
	ID      int
	Name    string
	Attempt int
}

// Result carries the outcome of an operation attempt.
type Result struct {
	OpID    int
	Success bool
	Message string
	Attempt int
}

// simulateAPI fails on first attempt, succeeds on second.
func simulateAPI(op Operation) Result {
	if op.Attempt < 2 {
		return Result{
			OpID:    op.ID,
			Success: false,
			Message: fmt.Sprintf("503 Service Unavailable (attempt %d)", op.Attempt),
			Attempt: op.Attempt,
		}
	}
	return Result{
		OpID:    op.ID,
		Success: true,
		Message: fmt.Sprintf("200 OK: %s completed (attempt %d)", op.Name, op.Attempt),
		Attempt: op.Attempt,
	}
}

// retryWorker reads from failed, waits, increments attempt, resends to output.
func retryWorker(failed <-chan Operation, output chan<- Operation, done chan<- struct{}) {
	defer func() { done <- struct{}{} }()
	for op := range failed {
		timer := time.NewTimer(fixedDelay)
		<-timer.C
		op.Attempt++
		fmt.Printf("  [retry] %s: retrying (attempt %d)\n", op.Name, op.Attempt)
		output <- op
	}
}

func main() {
	failed := make(chan Operation, 10)
	output := make(chan Operation, 10)
	done := make(chan struct{}, 1)

	go retryWorker(failed, output, done)

	op := Operation{ID: 1, Name: "create-vm", Attempt: 1}

	// First attempt.
	result := simulateAPI(op)
	fmt.Printf("attempt %d: %s\n", result.Attempt, result.Message)

	// Send to retry.
	failed <- op
	close(failed)

	// Receive retried operation.
	retriedOp := <-output
	result = simulateAPI(retriedOp)
	fmt.Printf("attempt %d: %s\n", result.Attempt, result.Message)

	<-done
}
```

Key observations:
- The retry worker uses `time.NewTimer` instead of `time.Sleep` -- timers can be stopped and are select-compatible
- The worker increments `Attempt` before resending, so the API call knows which attempt this is
- The `done` channel signals that the retry worker has finished processing

### Intermediate Verification
```bash
go run main.go
```
Expected output:
```
attempt 1: 503 Service Unavailable (attempt 1)
  [retry] create-vm: retrying (attempt 2)
attempt 2: 200 OK: create-vm completed (attempt 2)
```

## Step 2 -- Exponential Backoff with Jitter

Replace fixed delay with exponential backoff: each retry waits `baseDelay * 2^attempt`, plus random jitter to prevent thundering herd.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand/v2"
	"time"
)

const (
	baseDelay  = 100 * time.Millisecond
	maxDelay   = 2 * time.Second
	maxRetries = 5
)

type Operation struct {
	ID      int
	Name    string
	Attempt int
}

type Result struct {
	OpID    int
	Success bool
	Message string
	Attempt int
}

// simulateUnstableAPI fails for the first 3 attempts.
func simulateUnstableAPI(op Operation) Result {
	if op.Attempt <= 3 {
		return Result{
			OpID:    op.ID,
			Success: false,
			Message: fmt.Sprintf("503 error (attempt %d)", op.Attempt),
			Attempt: op.Attempt,
		}
	}
	return Result{
		OpID:    op.ID,
		Success: true,
		Message: fmt.Sprintf("200 OK: %s done (attempt %d)", op.Name, op.Attempt),
		Attempt: op.Attempt,
	}
}

// backoffDelay calculates exponential delay with jitter, capped at maxDelay.
func backoffDelay(attempt int) time.Duration {
	delay := baseDelay
	for i := 1; i < attempt; i++ {
		delay *= 2
		if delay > maxDelay {
			delay = maxDelay
			break
		}
	}
	// Add jitter: 0% to 50% of the delay.
	jitter := time.Duration(rand.Int64N(int64(delay / 2)))
	return delay + jitter
}

// retryLoop reads failed ops, applies backoff, resends or gives up.
func retryLoop(failed <-chan Operation, output chan<- Result) {
	for op := range failed {
		for op.Attempt <= maxRetries {
			result := simulateUnstableAPI(op)
			if result.Success {
				output <- result
				break
			}
			delay := backoffDelay(op.Attempt)
			fmt.Printf("  [retry] %s attempt %d failed, backoff %v\n",
				op.Name, op.Attempt, delay.Round(time.Millisecond))
			timer := time.NewTimer(delay)
			<-timer.C
			op.Attempt++
		}
		if op.Attempt > maxRetries {
			output <- Result{
				OpID:    op.ID,
				Success: false,
				Message: fmt.Sprintf("%s: exhausted %d retries", op.Name, maxRetries),
				Attempt: op.Attempt,
			}
		}
	}
	close(output)
}

func main() {
	failed := make(chan Operation, 10)
	output := make(chan Result, 10)

	go retryLoop(failed, output)

	epoch := time.Now()
	failed <- Operation{ID: 1, Name: "create-vm", Attempt: 1}
	close(failed)

	for result := range output {
		elapsed := time.Since(epoch).Round(time.Millisecond)
		status := "SUCCESS"
		if !result.Success {
			status = "FAILED"
		}
		fmt.Printf("[%v] %s: %s\n", elapsed, status, result.Message)
	}
}
```

The backoff doubles each attempt: ~100ms, ~200ms, ~400ms. Jitter adds 0-50% randomness so that multiple clients retrying the same endpoint do not all hit it at exactly the same moment.

### Intermediate Verification
```bash
go run main.go
```
Expected output (delays vary due to jitter):
```
  [retry] create-vm attempt 1 failed, backoff 120ms
  [retry] create-vm attempt 2 failed, backoff 250ms
  [retry] create-vm attempt 3 failed, backoff 480ms
[850ms] SUCCESS: 200 OK: create-vm done (attempt 4)
```

## Step 3 -- Dead-Letter Channel for Permanent Failures

Add a dead-letter channel: operations that exhaust all retries are routed there instead of being silently dropped.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand/v2"
	"time"
)

const (
	dlBaseDelay  = 50 * time.Millisecond
	dlMaxDelay   = 500 * time.Millisecond
	dlMaxRetries = 3
)

type Operation struct {
	ID      int
	Name    string
	Attempt int
}

type Result struct {
	OpID    int
	Success bool
	Message string
	Attempt int
}

// DeadLetter holds a permanently failed operation with context.
type DeadLetter struct {
	Op       Operation
	Reason   string
	FailedAt time.Time
}

// simulateFlaky fails based on operation ID: even IDs always fail, odd succeed on attempt 2.
func simulateFlaky(op Operation) Result {
	alwaysFails := op.ID%2 == 0
	if alwaysFails || op.Attempt < 2 {
		return Result{
			OpID:    op.ID,
			Success: false,
			Message: fmt.Sprintf("503 error (attempt %d)", op.Attempt),
			Attempt: op.Attempt,
		}
	}
	return Result{
		OpID:    op.ID,
		Success: true,
		Message: fmt.Sprintf("%s completed (attempt %d)", op.Name, op.Attempt),
		Attempt: op.Attempt,
	}
}

func backoffWithJitter(attempt int) time.Duration {
	delay := dlBaseDelay
	for i := 1; i < attempt; i++ {
		delay *= 2
		if delay > dlMaxDelay {
			delay = dlMaxDelay
			break
		}
	}
	jitter := time.Duration(rand.Int64N(int64(delay/4) + 1))
	return delay + jitter
}

// retryWithDeadLetter retries operations and routes permanent failures to deadLetters.
func retryWithDeadLetter(
	input <-chan Operation,
	results chan<- Result,
	deadLetters chan<- DeadLetter,
) {
	for op := range input {
		var lastResult Result
		succeeded := false
		for op.Attempt <= dlMaxRetries {
			lastResult = simulateFlaky(op)
			if lastResult.Success {
				results <- lastResult
				succeeded = true
				break
			}
			if op.Attempt == dlMaxRetries {
				break
			}
			delay := backoffWithJitter(op.Attempt)
			fmt.Printf("  [retry] op %d attempt %d failed, backoff %v\n",
				op.ID, op.Attempt, delay.Round(time.Millisecond))
			timer := time.NewTimer(delay)
			<-timer.C
			op.Attempt++
		}
		if !succeeded {
			deadLetters <- DeadLetter{
				Op:       op,
				Reason:   lastResult.Message,
				FailedAt: time.Now(),
			}
		}
	}
	close(results)
	close(deadLetters)
}

func main() {
	input := make(chan Operation, 10)
	results := make(chan Result, 10)
	deadLetters := make(chan DeadLetter, 10)

	go retryWithDeadLetter(input, results, deadLetters)

	operations := []Operation{
		{ID: 1, Name: "create-vm", Attempt: 1},
		{ID: 2, Name: "attach-disk", Attempt: 1},
		{ID: 3, Name: "configure-network", Attempt: 1},
		{ID: 4, Name: "install-agent", Attempt: 1},
	}

	for _, op := range operations {
		input <- op
	}
	close(input)

	// Drain both output channels.
	resultsDone := false
	deadDone := false
	successCount, deadCount := 0, 0

	for !resultsDone || !deadDone {
		select {
		case r, ok := <-results:
			if !ok {
				resultsDone = true
				continue
			}
			fmt.Printf("SUCCESS: op %d - %s\n", r.OpID, r.Message)
			successCount++
		case dl, ok := <-deadLetters:
			if !ok {
				deadDone = true
				continue
			}
			fmt.Printf("DEAD-LETTER: op %d (%s) - %s\n",
				dl.Op.ID, dl.Op.Name, dl.Reason)
			deadCount++
		}
	}

	fmt.Printf("\n=== Summary ===\n")
	fmt.Printf("Succeeded:    %d\n", successCount)
	fmt.Printf("Dead-lettered: %d\n", deadCount)
}
```

The dead-letter channel is a critical production pattern: it prevents permanent failures from being silently lost. A monitoring system can read from the dead-letter channel to trigger alerts or queue manual intervention.

### Intermediate Verification
```bash
go run main.go
```
Expected output (order may vary):
```
  [retry] op 1 attempt 1 failed, backoff 55ms
SUCCESS: op 1 - create-vm completed (attempt 2)
  [retry] op 2 attempt 1 failed, backoff 52ms
  [retry] op 2 attempt 2 failed, backoff 108ms
DEAD-LETTER: op 2 (attach-disk) - 503 error (attempt 3)
  [retry] op 3 attempt 1 failed, backoff 60ms
SUCCESS: op 3 - configure-network completed (attempt 2)
  [retry] op 4 attempt 1 failed, backoff 53ms
  [retry] op 4 attempt 2 failed, backoff 105ms
DEAD-LETTER: op 4 (install-agent) - 503 error (attempt 3)

=== Summary ===
Succeeded:    2
Dead-lettered: 2
```

## Step 4 -- Multiple Concurrent Retry Loops

Run 3 retry workers in parallel. Operations are distributed across workers, increasing throughput while each worker independently manages its own backoff timers.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand/v2"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

const (
	concBaseDelay  = 50 * time.Millisecond
	concMaxDelay   = 400 * time.Millisecond
	concMaxRetries = 3
	workerCount    = 3
	operationCount = 9
)

type Operation struct {
	ID      int
	Name    string
	Attempt int
}

type Result struct {
	OpID     int
	Success  bool
	Message  string
	Attempt  int
	WorkerID int
}

type DeadLetter struct {
	Op       Operation
	Reason   string
	WorkerID int
}

// simulateMixedAPI: ops 1-3 succeed on attempt 1, 4-6 on attempt 2, 7-9 always fail.
func simulateMixedAPI(op Operation) bool {
	switch {
	case op.ID <= 3:
		return true
	case op.ID <= 6:
		return op.Attempt >= 2
	default:
		return false
	}
}

func concBackoff(attempt int) time.Duration {
	delay := concBaseDelay
	for i := 1; i < attempt; i++ {
		delay *= 2
		if delay > concMaxDelay {
			delay = concMaxDelay
			break
		}
	}
	jitter := time.Duration(rand.Int64N(int64(delay/4) + 1))
	return delay + jitter
}

// retryWorker processes operations with retry logic.
func retryWorker(
	id int,
	input <-chan Operation,
	results chan<- Result,
	deadLetters chan<- DeadLetter,
	wg *sync.WaitGroup,
) {
	defer wg.Done()
	for op := range input {
		succeeded := false
		for op.Attempt <= concMaxRetries {
			if simulateMixedAPI(op) {
				results <- Result{
					OpID:     op.ID,
					Success:  true,
					Message:  fmt.Sprintf("%s completed", op.Name),
					Attempt:  op.Attempt,
					WorkerID: id,
				}
				succeeded = true
				break
			}
			if op.Attempt == concMaxRetries {
				break
			}
			delay := concBackoff(op.Attempt)
			fmt.Printf("  [worker %d] op %d attempt %d failed, backoff %v\n",
				id, op.ID, op.Attempt, delay.Round(time.Millisecond))
			timer := time.NewTimer(delay)
			<-timer.C
			op.Attempt++
		}
		if !succeeded {
			deadLetters <- DeadLetter{
				Op:       op,
				Reason:   fmt.Sprintf("exhausted %d retries", concMaxRetries),
				WorkerID: id,
			}
		}
	}
}

func main() {
	input := make(chan Operation, operationCount)
	results := make(chan Result, operationCount)
	deadLetters := make(chan DeadLetter, operationCount)

	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	for i := 1; i <= workerCount; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go retryWorker(i, input, results, deadLetters, &wg)
	}

	// Submit operations.
	epoch := time.Now()
	for i := 1; i <= operationCount; i++ {
		input <- Operation{
			ID:      i,
			Name:    fmt.Sprintf("provision-step-%d", i),
			Attempt: 1,
		}
	}
	close(input)

	// Wait for all workers, then close output channels.
	go func() {
		wg.Wait()
		close(results)
		close(deadLetters)
	}()

	// Drain results.
	successCount, deadCount := 0, 0
	resultsDone, deadDone := false, false

	for !resultsDone || !deadDone {
		select {
		case r, ok := <-results:
			if !ok {
				resultsDone = true
				continue
			}
			fmt.Printf("SUCCESS [worker %d]: op %d %s (attempt %d)\n",
				r.WorkerID, r.OpID, r.Message, r.Attempt)
			successCount++
		case dl, ok := <-deadLetters:
			if !ok {
				deadDone = true
				continue
			}
			fmt.Printf("DEAD [worker %d]: op %d (%s) - %s\n",
				dl.WorkerID, dl.Op.ID, dl.Op.Name, dl.Reason)
			deadCount++
		}
	}

	elapsed := time.Since(epoch).Round(time.Millisecond)
	fmt.Printf("\n=== Summary ===\n")
	fmt.Printf("Workers:       %d\n", workerCount)
	fmt.Printf("Operations:    %d\n", operationCount)
	fmt.Printf("Succeeded:     %d\n", successCount)
	fmt.Printf("Dead-lettered: %d\n", deadCount)
	fmt.Printf("Wall time:     %v\n", elapsed)
}
```

Three workers process operations concurrently. Ops 1-3 succeed immediately, ops 4-6 need one retry, ops 7-9 exhaust retries and go to dead-letter. Wall time is much less than sequential because workers retry in parallel.

### Intermediate Verification
```bash
go run -race main.go
```
Expected output (order varies):
```
SUCCESS [worker 1]: op 1 provision-step-1 completed (attempt 1)
SUCCESS [worker 2]: op 2 provision-step-2 completed (attempt 1)
SUCCESS [worker 3]: op 3 provision-step-3 completed (attempt 1)
  [worker 1] op 4 attempt 1 failed, backoff 55ms
  [worker 2] op 5 attempt 1 failed, backoff 58ms
  ...
SUCCESS [worker 1]: op 4 provision-step-4 completed (attempt 2)
DEAD [worker 3]: op 9 (provision-step-9) - exhausted 3 retries
...

=== Summary ===
Workers:       3
Operations:    9
Succeeded:     6
Dead-lettered: 3
Wall time:     Xms
```

## Common Mistakes

### Using time.Sleep Instead of time.Timer
**What happens:** `time.Sleep` blocks the goroutine unconditionally. You cannot cancel the sleep with a context or select statement. In production, a shutdown signal arrives but the goroutine sleeps for 30 seconds before noticing.
**Fix:** Use `time.NewTimer(delay)` and wait on `timer.C` inside a `select`. This lets you also listen for a cancellation channel: `select { case <-timer.C: ... case <-ctx.Done(): ... }`.

### No Jitter on Backoff
**What happens:** 100 clients all fail at the same time and retry at exactly the same intervals (100ms, 200ms, 400ms). The server gets hit by the same thundering herd at each retry wave, making the outage worse.
**Fix:** Add random jitter (typically 0-50% of the delay) so clients spread their retries over time. This is why `backoffDelay` adds a random component.

### Closing Output Channels from the Wrong Goroutine
**What happens:** With multiple workers sharing the same output channels, one worker finishes and closes the channel while another is still sending. Sending to a closed channel panics.
**Fix:** Use a `sync.WaitGroup` to wait for all workers, then close the output channels from a separate goroutine after `wg.Wait()` returns.

## Verify What You Learned
Add context-based cancellation: pass a `context.Context` to each retry worker. When the context is cancelled, workers abandon in-progress retries immediately (stop waiting on the backoff timer) and drain their remaining operations to the dead-letter channel. Verify that cancelling the context during backoff stops retries within one timer tick.

## What's Next
Continue to [25. Ordered Fan-Out Results](../25-ordered-fan-out-results/25-ordered-fan-out-results.md) to learn how to preserve input ordering when distributing work across concurrent goroutines -- using sequence numbers and a channel-based resequencing buffer.

## Summary
- Retry logic belongs in a dedicated channel pipeline stage, not scattered across call sites
- `time.NewTimer` is preferred over `time.Sleep` because timers are cancellable and select-compatible
- Exponential backoff with jitter prevents thundering herd during transient outages
- A dead-letter channel captures permanently failed operations instead of silently dropping them
- Multiple concurrent retry workers increase throughput while each manages independent backoff
- Output channels are closed by a coordinator goroutine after all workers finish, never by individual workers
