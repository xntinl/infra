# 7. Nil Channel Behavior

## Learning Objectives
After completing this exercise, you will be able to:
- **Predict** the behavior of nil channels (block forever on send and receive)
- **Use** nil channels in `select` to dynamically disable cases
- **Implement** the "set to nil after close" pattern for merging multiple channels
- **Distinguish** between nil, open, and closed channel behavior

## Why Nil Channels

Consider a system that merges sorted data from multiple sources -- a database query stream and a cache stream, for example. Each stream finishes at a different time. When the cache stream is exhausted, you need to stop reading from it but continue reading from the database stream until it also finishes.

Without nil channels, you would need complex boolean flags, nested if-statements, and careful coordination. With nil channels, when one source closes, you set its variable to nil. The `select` naturally stops considering that case. The code is cleaner, shorter, and harder to get wrong.

This pattern appears in production code for merging event streams, implementing timeouts that can be canceled, and building state machines where available operations change over time.

## Channel State Summary

| State | Send | Receive | Close |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| nil | Block forever | Block forever | panic |
| open, empty | Block (if unbuffered or full) | Block | OK |
| open, has data | Send or block | Receive value | OK |
| closed | panic | Zero value (ok=false) | panic |

## Step 1 -- Nil Channel Blocks Forever

Demonstrate that a nil channel blocks on both send and receive. This is not a bug -- it is a property we will exploit in `select`.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

const nilProbeTimeout = 200 * time.Millisecond

// proveReceiveBlocks shows that receiving from a nil channel blocks forever,
// using a select with a timeout to avoid a deadlock.
func proveReceiveBlocks(ch <-chan int, timeout time.Duration) {
	select {
	case val := <-ch:
		fmt.Println("received:", val) // never happens
	case <-time.After(timeout):
		fmt.Println("receive on nil channel: blocked (timed out as expected)")
	}
}

// proveSendBlocks shows that sending on a nil channel blocks forever.
func proveSendBlocks(ch chan<- int, timeout time.Duration) {
	select {
	case ch <- 42:
		fmt.Println("sent") // never happens
	case <-time.After(timeout):
		fmt.Println("send on nil channel: blocked (timed out as expected)")
	}
}

func main() {
	var ch chan int // nil -- not initialized with make()
	proveReceiveBlocks(ch, nilProbeTimeout)
	proveSendBlocks(ch, nilProbeTimeout)
}
```

### Verification
```bash
go run main.go
# Expected:
#   receive on nil channel: blocked (timed out as expected)
#   send on nil channel: blocked (timed out as expected)
```

Without the `select` + timeout, `<-ch` on a nil channel would deadlock (or block the goroutine forever if other goroutines exist).

## Step 2 -- Nil Channel in Select Is Skipped

When a channel variable is nil, its `select` case is never chosen -- as if it does not exist. This is the key insight that makes nil channels useful.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// selectFromStreams demonstrates that nil channels are skipped in select.
// Only non-nil channels with data are eligible for selection.
func selectFromStreams(dbStream <-chan string, cacheStream <-chan string) {
	select {
	case val := <-dbStream:
		fmt.Println("from database:", val) // never chosen -- dbStream is nil
	case val := <-cacheStream:
		fmt.Println("from cache:", val) // always chosen
	}
}

func main() {
	var dbStream chan string // nil -- this case will be skipped
	cacheStream := make(chan string, 1)
	cacheStream <- "user:42:cached"

	selectFromStreams(dbStream, cacheStream)
}
```

You can dynamically control which select cases are active by assigning channel variables to nil or to a real channel.

### Verification
```bash
go run main.go
# Expected: from cache: user:42:cached
```

## Step 3 -- Merging Sorted Streams

The core pattern: merge values from two sorted streams until both are exhausted. When one stream closes, set it to nil so `select` stops trying to read from it. The other stream continues until it also closes.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// sortedStream sends each value in order and closes the channel.
func sortedStream(values []int) <-chan int {
	ch := make(chan int)
	go func() {
		for _, v := range values {
			ch <- v
		}
		close(ch)
	}()
	return ch
}

// mergeSorted merges two channels into one. When a source closes, it is
// set to nil so select stops considering it. The loop exits when both are nil.
func mergeSorted(streamA, streamB <-chan int) <-chan int {
	out := make(chan int)
	go func() {
		defer close(out)
		for streamA != nil || streamB != nil {
			select {
			case val, ok := <-streamA:
				if !ok {
					fmt.Println("  [merge] stream A exhausted -- disabling")
					streamA = nil
					continue
				}
				out <- val
			case val, ok := <-streamB:
				if !ok {
					fmt.Println("  [merge] stream B exhausted -- disabling")
					streamB = nil
					continue
				}
				out <- val
			}
		}
	}()
	return out
}

// drainAndCount receives all values from merged, prints them, and returns the count.
func drainAndCount(merged <-chan int) int {
	count := 0
	for val := range merged {
		fmt.Printf("  %d\n", val)
		count++
	}
	return count
}

func main() {
	streamA := sortedStream([]int{10, 30, 50})
	streamB := sortedStream([]int{20, 40, 60, 80, 100})

	fmt.Println("Merged output:")
	merged := mergeSorted(streamA, streamB)
	count := drainAndCount(merged)
	fmt.Printf("Merge complete: %d values from both streams\n", count)
}
```

When `a` is closed, we set `a = nil`. The next iteration still enters `select`, but `case <-a` is skipped because `a` is nil. Only `case <-b` is considered. When both are nil, the loop exits.

### Verification
```bash
go run main.go
# Expected: all 8 values from both streams (interleaved order may vary),
# then "Merge complete: 8 values from both streams"
```

## Step 4 -- Merging Three Data Sources with Dynamic Disabling

Extend the pattern to merge three sources -- a scenario you encounter when aggregating data from multiple microservices. Each service responds at a different speed and produces a different number of results.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

// Event represents a message from one of the microservices.
type Event struct {
	Source string
	Data   string
}

// eventStream produces events at the given rate, then closes the channel.
func eventStream(source string, events []string, delay time.Duration) <-chan Event {
	ch := make(chan Event)
	go func() {
		for _, data := range events {
			time.Sleep(delay)
			ch <- Event{Source: source, Data: data}
		}
		close(ch)
	}()
	return ch
}

// allSourcesExhausted returns true when every channel in the slice is nil.
func allSourcesExhausted(sources []<-chan Event) bool {
	for _, ch := range sources {
		if ch != nil {
			return false
		}
	}
	return true
}

// mergeThreeSources merges exactly three event channels using nil-disabling.
// For 3 known sources, explicit select is clearer than reflect-based approaches.
func mergeThreeSources(sources [3]<-chan Event) <-chan Event {
	out := make(chan Event)
	go func() {
		defer close(out)
		active := sources[:]
		slice := make([]<-chan Event, len(active))
		copy(slice, active[:])

		for !allSourcesExhausted(slice) {
			select {
			case ev, ok := <-slice[0]:
				if !ok {
					slice[0] = nil
					continue
				}
				out <- ev
			case ev, ok := <-slice[1]:
				if !ok {
					slice[1] = nil
					continue
				}
				out <- ev
			case ev, ok := <-slice[2]:
				if !ok {
					slice[2] = nil
					continue
				}
				out <- ev
			}
		}
	}()
	return out
}

func main() {
	userSvc := eventStream("users", []string{"user-created", "user-updated"}, 30*time.Millisecond)
	orderSvc := eventStream("orders", []string{"order-placed", "order-shipped", "order-delivered"}, 20*time.Millisecond)
	paymentSvc := eventStream("payments", []string{"payment-received"}, 50*time.Millisecond)

	sources := [3]<-chan Event{userSvc, orderSvc, paymentSvc}
	merged := mergeThreeSources(sources)

	fmt.Println("Aggregating events from 3 services:")
	for ev := range merged {
		fmt.Printf("  [%-8s] %s\n", ev.Source, ev.Data)
	}
	fmt.Println("All services exhausted")
}
```

### Verification
```bash
go run main.go
# Expected: all 6 events from 3 services, interleaved by timing, then "All services exhausted"
```

## Step 5 -- Dynamic Enable/Disable: Pausable Worker

Use nil channels to model a worker with pause/resume capabilities. When paused, the task channel variable is set to nil, disabling task processing in the select. When resumed, it is restored.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

const (
	taskQueueSize        = 10
	totalDeployTasks     = 8
	taskExecDuration     = 40 * time.Millisecond
	preMaintenanceDelay  = 150 * time.Millisecond
	maintenanceDuration  = 200 * time.Millisecond
	postResumeDelay      = 250 * time.Millisecond
)

// PausableWorker processes tasks from a channel and can be paused/resumed
// at runtime by setting its active channel to nil or restoring it.
type PausableWorker struct {
	tasks    chan string
	pauseCh  chan struct{}
	resumeCh chan struct{}
	done     chan struct{}
}

// NewPausableWorker creates a worker with the given task queue size.
func NewPausableWorker(queueSize int) *PausableWorker {
	return &PausableWorker{
		tasks:    make(chan string, queueSize),
		pauseCh:  make(chan struct{}),
		resumeCh: make(chan struct{}),
		done:     make(chan struct{}),
	}
}

// Run processes tasks until the channel is closed. Pause/resume signals
// toggle the active channel between the real channel and nil.
func (pw *PausableWorker) Run() {
	active := pw.tasks
	for {
		select {
		case task, ok := <-active:
			if !ok {
				fmt.Println("Worker: all tasks complete, exiting")
				pw.done <- struct{}{}
				return
			}
			fmt.Println("Worker: executing", task)
			time.Sleep(taskExecDuration)
		case <-pw.pauseCh:
			fmt.Println("Worker: PAUSED (maintenance window)")
			active = nil
		case <-pw.resumeCh:
			fmt.Println("Worker: RESUMED")
			active = pw.tasks
		}
	}
}

// Pause signals the worker to stop processing tasks.
func (pw *PausableWorker) Pause()  { pw.pauseCh <- struct{}{} }

// Resume signals the worker to continue processing.
func (pw *PausableWorker) Resume() { pw.resumeCh <- struct{}{} }

// Shutdown closes the task channel and waits for the worker to exit.
func (pw *PausableWorker) Shutdown() {
	close(pw.tasks)
	<-pw.done
}

func main() {
	worker := NewPausableWorker(taskQueueSize)

	for i := 1; i <= totalDeployTasks; i++ {
		worker.tasks <- fmt.Sprintf("deploy-service-%d", i)
	}

	go worker.Run()

	time.Sleep(preMaintenanceDelay)
	worker.Pause()
	fmt.Println("Main: pause sent -- simulating maintenance window")

	time.Sleep(maintenanceDuration)
	worker.Resume()
	fmt.Println("Main: resume sent -- maintenance complete")

	time.Sleep(postResumeDelay)
	worker.Shutdown()
}
```

### Verification
```bash
go run main.go
# Expected: worker processes some tasks, pauses, resumes, processes remaining, exits
```

## Intermediate Verification

Run the programs and confirm:
1. Nil channels block forever on send and receive
2. Nil channels are skipped in select statements
3. Setting a channel to nil after close prevents select from spinning on zero values
4. The merge pattern correctly handles sources that close at different times

## Common Mistakes

### Forgetting That var Declares a Nil Channel

**Wrong:**
```go
package main

func main() {
    var results chan int
    go func() {
        results <- 42 // blocks forever -- results is nil!
    }()
    <-results // also blocks forever
}
```

**What happens:** Both goroutines block permanently on the nil channel. Deadlock.

**Fix:** Always use `make(chan int)` to create a usable channel.

### Not Checking All Channels Are Nil Before Exiting

**Wrong:**
```go
for {
    select {
    case val, ok := <-a:
        if !ok { return } // exits when a closes, losing remaining b values!
    case val, ok := <-b:
        if !ok { return }
    }
}
```

**What happens:** When `a` closes, you return immediately, losing all remaining values in `b`.

**Correct:** Set to nil instead of returning. Only exit when both are nil:
```go
for a != nil || b != nil {
    select {
    case val, ok := <-a:
        if !ok { a = nil; continue }
        process(val)
    case val, ok := <-b:
        if !ok { b = nil; continue }
        process(val)
    }
}
```

## Verify What You Learned
1. What happens when you read from a nil channel outside of a select?
2. Why is setting a closed channel to nil better than just checking `ok` each time?
3. How would you merge 10 channels using the nil pattern without writing 10 select cases?

## Summary
- A nil channel blocks forever on both send and receive
- In `select`, a nil channel's case is never chosen (effectively disabled)
- Set a channel to nil after it closes to stop `select` from considering it
- Pattern for merging N channels: loop while any channel is non-nil, set to nil as each closes
- This enables dynamic state machines where available operations change at runtime
- Always initialize channels with `make()` unless you intentionally want nil behavior
