# 19. Channel Orchestration

## Learning Objectives
After completing this exercise, you will be able to:
- **Coordinate** dependent tasks using "done" channels that signal completion
- **Model** task dependency graphs where goroutines wait on upstream channels before starting
- **Build** diamond-shaped dependency patterns with parallel branches converging on a single task
- **Verify** correct execution ordering by inspecting actual start/end timestamps

## Why Channel Orchestration

Deploying an application is not a flat list of steps. Some tasks depend on others: you cannot start the app until the Docker image is pulled and the database migration is complete. But pulling the image and running the migration are independent -- they should run in parallel to minimize deployment time.

Channels model these dependencies naturally. Each task gets a "done" channel. When a task finishes, it closes its done channel. Dependent tasks receive from their dependency channels before starting -- the receive blocks until the channel is closed. No polling, no shared flags, no timing assumptions. The dependency graph is encoded directly in channel relationships.

This pattern scales from simple sequential chains to complex DAGs (directed acyclic graphs) where multiple branches run in parallel and converge at synchronization points.

## Step 1 -- Two Independent Tasks in Parallel

Start with the simplest case: two tasks with no dependencies run concurrently. Each task closes its "done" channel when finished. The main goroutine waits for both.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

const (
	pullImageDuration = 300 * time.Millisecond
	runMigrationDuration = 200 * time.Millisecond
)

// DeployTask represents a deployment step with a name and simulated duration.
type DeployTask struct {
	Name     string
	Duration time.Duration
}

// RunTask executes a task and closes its done channel when finished.
// The epoch parameter is used to print timestamps relative to deployment start.
func RunTask(task DeployTask, done chan struct{}, epoch time.Time) {
	start := time.Since(epoch).Round(time.Millisecond)
	fmt.Printf("[%6s] START  %s\n", start, task.Name)

	time.Sleep(task.Duration)

	end := time.Since(epoch).Round(time.Millisecond)
	fmt.Printf("[%6s] DONE   %s\n", end, task.Name)
	close(done)
}

func main() {
	epoch := time.Now()

	pullDone := make(chan struct{})
	migrateDone := make(chan struct{})

	pullImage := DeployTask{Name: "pull-docker-image", Duration: pullImageDuration}
	runMigration := DeployTask{Name: "run-db-migration", Duration: runMigrationDuration}

	go RunTask(pullImage, pullDone, epoch)
	go RunTask(runMigration, migrateDone, epoch)

	<-pullDone
	<-migrateDone

	elapsed := time.Since(epoch).Round(time.Millisecond)
	fmt.Printf("[%6s] ALL TASKS COMPLETE\n", elapsed)
}
```

Key observations:
- Both tasks start at approximately the same time (~0ms)
- Total time is the maximum of the two durations, not the sum
- `close(done)` is the signal -- receiving from a closed channel returns immediately
- Closing (rather than sending a value) allows multiple goroutines to wait on the same done channel

### Verification
```bash
go run main.go
# Expected: both tasks start near 0ms, total ~300ms (not 500ms)
#   [   0s] START  pull-docker-image
#   [   0s] START  run-db-migration
#   [ 200ms] DONE   run-db-migration
#   [ 300ms] DONE   pull-docker-image
#   [ 300ms] ALL TASKS COMPLETE
```

## Step 2 -- Three Tasks Chained Sequentially

Now model strict sequential dependencies: pull image, then migrate, then start app. Each task waits for its predecessor's done channel before beginning.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

const (
	seqPullDuration    = 200 * time.Millisecond
	seqMigrateDuration = 150 * time.Millisecond
	seqStartDuration   = 100 * time.Millisecond
)

// DeployTask represents a deployment step with dependencies.
type DeployTask struct {
	Name      string
	Duration  time.Duration
	DependsOn []<-chan struct{}
}

// RunTask waits for all dependency channels to close, executes the task,
// then closes its own done channel.
func RunTask(task DeployTask, done chan struct{}, epoch time.Time) {
	for _, dep := range task.DependsOn {
		<-dep
	}

	start := time.Since(epoch).Round(time.Millisecond)
	fmt.Printf("[%6s] START  %s\n", start, task.Name)

	time.Sleep(task.Duration)

	end := time.Since(epoch).Round(time.Millisecond)
	fmt.Printf("[%6s] DONE   %s\n", end, task.Name)
	close(done)
}

func main() {
	epoch := time.Now()

	pullDone := make(chan struct{})
	migrateDone := make(chan struct{})
	startDone := make(chan struct{})

	pull := DeployTask{
		Name:     "pull-image",
		Duration: seqPullDuration,
	}
	migrate := DeployTask{
		Name:      "run-migration",
		Duration:  seqMigrateDuration,
		DependsOn: []<-chan struct{}{pullDone},
	}
	startApp := DeployTask{
		Name:      "start-app",
		Duration:  seqStartDuration,
		DependsOn: []<-chan struct{}{migrateDone},
	}

	go RunTask(pull, pullDone, epoch)
	go RunTask(migrate, migrateDone, epoch)
	go RunTask(startApp, startDone, epoch)

	<-startDone

	elapsed := time.Since(epoch).Round(time.Millisecond)
	fmt.Printf("[%6s] DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE\n", elapsed)
}
```

All three goroutines are launched immediately, but the dependency channels ensure correct ordering: migrate waits for pull, start-app waits for migrate. Total time is the sum of all three durations.

### Verification
```bash
go run main.go
# Expected: sequential chain, total ~450ms
#   [   0s] START  pull-image
#   [ 200ms] DONE   pull-image
#   [ 200ms] START  run-migration
#   [ 350ms] DONE   run-migration
#   [ 350ms] START  start-app
#   [ 450ms] DONE   start-app
#   [ 450ms] DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE
```

## Step 3 -- Diamond Dependency: Parallel Branches Converge

The real deployment pattern: pull image (A) and seed cache (B) have no dependencies and run in parallel. Run migration (C) depends only on A. Start app (D) depends on both B and C. This forms a diamond shape.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

const (
	diamondPullDuration    = 300 * time.Millisecond
	diamondCacheDuration   = 200 * time.Millisecond
	diamondMigrateDuration = 150 * time.Millisecond
	diamondStartDuration   = 100 * time.Millisecond
)

// DeployTask represents a deployment step with a name, duration, and dependencies.
type DeployTask struct {
	Name      string
	Duration  time.Duration
	DependsOn []<-chan struct{}
}

// RunTask waits for all dependencies, executes, and signals completion.
func RunTask(task DeployTask, done chan struct{}, epoch time.Time) {
	for _, dep := range task.DependsOn {
		<-dep
	}

	start := time.Since(epoch).Round(time.Millisecond)
	fmt.Printf("[%6s] START  %s\n", start, task.Name)

	time.Sleep(task.Duration)

	end := time.Since(epoch).Round(time.Millisecond)
	fmt.Printf("[%6s] DONE   %s\n", end, task.Name)
	close(done)
}

func main() {
	epoch := time.Now()

	// Dependency graph (diamond):
	//
	//   pull-image (A) ----> run-migration (C) ---+
	//                                              +--> start-app (D)
	//   seed-cache (B) --------------------------+

	pullDone := make(chan struct{})
	cacheDone := make(chan struct{})
	migrateDone := make(chan struct{})
	startDone := make(chan struct{})

	pull := DeployTask{Name: "pull-image", Duration: diamondPullDuration}
	cache := DeployTask{Name: "seed-cache", Duration: diamondCacheDuration}
	migrate := DeployTask{
		Name:      "run-migration",
		Duration:  diamondMigrateDuration,
		DependsOn: []<-chan struct{}{pullDone},
	}
	startApp := DeployTask{
		Name:      "start-app",
		Duration:  diamondStartDuration,
		DependsOn: []<-chan struct{}{migrateDone, cacheDone},
	}

	go RunTask(pull, pullDone, epoch)
	go RunTask(cache, cacheDone, epoch)
	go RunTask(migrate, migrateDone, epoch)
	go RunTask(startApp, startDone, epoch)

	<-startDone

	elapsed := time.Since(epoch).Round(time.Millisecond)
	fmt.Printf("[%6s] DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE\n", elapsed)
	fmt.Println("\nDependency graph:")
	fmt.Println("  pull-image (A) --> run-migration (C) --+")
	fmt.Println("                                          +--> start-app (D)")
	fmt.Println("  seed-cache (B) ------------------------+")
}
```

The critical path is A -> C -> D (300 + 150 + 100 = 550ms). B (200ms) runs in parallel with A and finishes well before D needs it. Total deployment time follows the critical path, not the sum of all tasks.

### Verification
```bash
go run main.go
# Expected: A and B start at 0ms, C starts at ~300ms, D starts at ~450ms
# Total ~550ms (critical path: A -> C -> D)
```

## Step 4 -- Full Deployment with Timeline Report

Build a complete deployment orchestrator that records actual start/end times and prints a timeline proving the dependency ordering was respected.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sort"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

const (
	taskPullImage     = 250 * time.Millisecond
	taskSeedCache     = 180 * time.Millisecond
	taskRunMigration  = 200 * time.Millisecond
	taskHealthCheck   = 80 * time.Millisecond
	taskStartApp      = 120 * time.Millisecond
	taskConfigureProxy = 60 * time.Millisecond
)

// TaskRecord captures the actual execution timeline of a task.
type TaskRecord struct {
	Name  string
	Start time.Duration
	End   time.Duration
}

// DeployTask describes a task with its dependencies.
type DeployTask struct {
	Name      string
	Duration  time.Duration
	DependsOn []<-chan struct{}
}

// Orchestrator manages task execution and collects timeline records.
type Orchestrator struct {
	epoch   time.Time
	mu      sync.Mutex
	records []TaskRecord
}

// NewOrchestrator creates an orchestrator with the given reference epoch.
func NewOrchestrator(epoch time.Time) *Orchestrator {
	return &Orchestrator{epoch: epoch}
}

// Launch starts a task in a new goroutine, returning its done channel.
func (o *Orchestrator) Launch(task DeployTask) chan struct{} {
	done := make(chan struct{})
	go func() {
		for _, dep := range task.DependsOn {
			<-dep
		}

		startOffset := time.Since(o.epoch)
		fmt.Printf("[%6s] START  %s\n", startOffset.Round(time.Millisecond), task.Name)

		time.Sleep(task.Duration)

		endOffset := time.Since(o.epoch)
		fmt.Printf("[%6s] DONE   %s\n", endOffset.Round(time.Millisecond), task.Name)

		o.mu.Lock()
		o.records = append(o.records, TaskRecord{
			Name:  task.Name,
			Start: startOffset.Round(time.Millisecond),
			End:   endOffset.Round(time.Millisecond),
		})
		o.mu.Unlock()

		close(done)
	}()
	return done
}

// PrintTimeline displays all tasks sorted by start time.
func (o *Orchestrator) PrintTimeline() {
	o.mu.Lock()
	sorted := make([]TaskRecord, len(o.records))
	copy(sorted, o.records)
	o.mu.Unlock()

	sort.Slice(sorted, func(i, j int) bool {
		return sorted[i].Start < sorted[j].Start
	})

	fmt.Println("\n=== Deployment Timeline ===")
	fmt.Printf("%-20s %10s %10s %10s\n", "TASK", "START", "END", "DURATION")
	fmt.Println("-------------------------------------------------------")
	for _, r := range sorted {
		fmt.Printf("%-20s %10s %10s %10s\n", r.Name, r.Start, r.End, r.End-r.Start)
	}
}

func main() {
	epoch := time.Now()
	orch := NewOrchestrator(epoch)

	// Dependency graph:
	//
	//   pull-image -----> run-migration ---+
	//        |                              +--> start-app --> configure-proxy
	//        +------> health-check         |
	//                                      |
	//   seed-cache -----------------------+

	pullDone := orch.Launch(DeployTask{
		Name: "pull-image", Duration: taskPullImage,
	})
	cacheDone := orch.Launch(DeployTask{
		Name: "seed-cache", Duration: taskSeedCache,
	})
	migrateDone := orch.Launch(DeployTask{
		Name: "run-migration", Duration: taskRunMigration,
		DependsOn: []<-chan struct{}{pullDone},
	})
	_ = orch.Launch(DeployTask{
		Name: "health-check", Duration: taskHealthCheck,
		DependsOn: []<-chan struct{}{pullDone},
	})
	startDone := orch.Launch(DeployTask{
		Name: "start-app", Duration: taskStartApp,
		DependsOn: []<-chan struct{}{migrateDone, cacheDone},
	})
	proxyDone := orch.Launch(DeployTask{
		Name: "configure-proxy", Duration: taskConfigureProxy,
		DependsOn: []<-chan struct{}{startDone},
	})

	<-proxyDone

	elapsed := time.Since(epoch).Round(time.Millisecond)
	fmt.Printf("\n[%6s] DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE\n", elapsed)
	orch.PrintTimeline()
}
```

### Verification
```bash
go run -race main.go
# Expected: timeline shows correct dependency ordering
# pull-image and seed-cache start at ~0ms
# run-migration and health-check start after pull-image completes (~250ms)
# start-app starts after both run-migration and seed-cache complete (~450ms)
# configure-proxy starts after start-app completes (~570ms)
# No race warnings
```

## Common Mistakes

### Sending a Value Instead of Closing the Done Channel

**Wrong:**
```go
done := make(chan struct{})
go func() {
    doWork()
    done <- struct{}{} // only one receiver gets the signal
}()
```

**What happens:** If two tasks depend on the same done channel, only one receives the signal. The other blocks forever.

**Fix:** Always close the done channel. A closed channel returns the zero value to all receivers, forever:
```go
done := make(chan struct{})
go func() {
    doWork()
    close(done) // all receivers unblock immediately
}()
```

### Circular Dependencies

**Wrong:**
```go
aDone := make(chan struct{})
bDone := make(chan struct{})
// A depends on B, B depends on A -- deadlock
go RunTask(DeployTask{DependsOn: []<-chan struct{}{bDone}}, aDone, epoch)
go RunTask(DeployTask{DependsOn: []<-chan struct{}{aDone}}, bDone, epoch)
```

**What happens:** Both goroutines block waiting for each other. Go's runtime detects the deadlock if no other goroutines are running.

**Fix:** Dependency graphs must be acyclic. Draw the graph before coding it. If you have cycles, restructure the tasks.

### Closing a Channel Twice

**Wrong:**
```go
done := make(chan struct{})
close(done)
close(done) // panic: close of closed channel
```

**Fix:** The task that creates the done channel closes it exactly once. Use the `RunTask` pattern where close is the last statement.

## Verify What You Learned
1. Why do we close the done channel instead of sending a value through it?
2. What determines the total deployment time in a diamond dependency graph?
3. How does `RunTask` handle multiple dependencies -- does it wait for them in order, and does the order matter?

## What's Next
Continue to [20-bounded-work-queue](../20-bounded-work-queue/20-bounded-work-queue.md) to build a task queue that uses channel capacity to accept or reject work without blocking.

## Summary
- Each task gets a "done" channel (`chan struct{}`) that it closes when finished
- Dependent tasks receive from their dependency channels before starting -- the receive blocks until the channel is closed
- Closing a channel (vs. sending a value) allows multiple dependents to wait on the same signal
- Independent tasks run in parallel; total time is the critical path, not the sum
- The `DependsOn` slice pattern models arbitrary DAGs with channels
- Always draw the dependency graph before writing the code -- cycles mean deadlocks
