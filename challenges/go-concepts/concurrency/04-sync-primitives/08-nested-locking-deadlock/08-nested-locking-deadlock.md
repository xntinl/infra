# 8. Nested Locking and Deadlock


## Learning Objectives
After completing this exercise, you will be able to:
- **Identify** deadlock conditions caused by inconsistent lock ordering
- **Analyze** the "circular wait" condition in nested locking scenarios
- **Fix** deadlocks by establishing consistent lock ordering
- **Recognize** Go's runtime deadlock detector output

## Why Deadlock Prevention Matters
A deadlock occurs when two or more goroutines are each waiting for the other to release a lock, creating a circular dependency where no goroutine can proceed. The program freezes permanently with no error message beyond Go's runtime detection of "all goroutines are asleep."

The most common real-world scenario: bank account transfers. Two accounts each have their own mutex. Transferring money from A to B requires locking both accounts. If two concurrent transfers lock in opposite order -- transfer(A,B) locks A then B, while transfer(B,A) locks B then A -- you get a deadlock.

Deadlocks from nested locking are particularly dangerous because:
- They may not manifest during testing if the timing is just right
- They require specific interleaving of goroutine execution to trigger
- They are invisible at compile time
- Once triggered in production, the affected goroutines hang forever while the rest of the server continues, creating a partial freeze that is extremely hard to diagnose

The four conditions for deadlock (Coffman conditions):
1. **Mutual exclusion**: at least one resource is non-shareable (mutex)
2. **Hold and wait**: a goroutine holds one lock while waiting for another
3. **No preemption**: locks can only be released voluntarily
4. **Circular wait**: goroutine A waits for B's lock, B waits for A's lock

Breaking any one condition prevents deadlock. The most practical approach in Go is to break the **circular wait** by establishing a **consistent lock ordering**: always acquire locks in the same order, regardless of which goroutine is executing.

## Step 1 -- The Deadlock: Bank Transfer Gone Wrong

Two concurrent transfers lock accounts in opposite order, creating a classic deadlock:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

const (
	initialBalance   = 1000
	lockAcquireDelay = 50 * time.Millisecond
)

type Account struct {
	ID      int
	Name    string
	mu      sync.Mutex
	balance int
}

func NewAccount(id int, name string, balance int) *Account {
	return &Account{ID: id, Name: name, balance: balance}
}

func transferUnsafe(from, to *Account, amount int) {
	from.mu.Lock()
	fmt.Printf("  Transfer %s->%s: locked %s\n", from.Name, to.Name, from.Name)
	time.Sleep(lockAcquireDelay) // give the other transfer time to lock
	fmt.Printf("  Transfer %s->%s: waiting for %s...\n", from.Name, to.Name, to.Name)
	to.mu.Lock() // BLOCKED if the other transfer holds this lock

	if from.balance >= amount {
		from.balance -= amount
		to.balance += amount
	}

	to.mu.Unlock()
	from.mu.Unlock()
}

func demonstrateDeadlock() {
	alice := NewAccount(1, "Alice", initialBalance)
	bob := NewAccount(2, "Bob", initialBalance)

	fmt.Println("=== DEADLOCK DEMO (will freeze) ===")
	fmt.Println("Two transfers locking in opposite order:")
	fmt.Println("  Transfer 1: Alice -> Bob (locks Alice first)")
	fmt.Println("  Transfer 2: Bob -> Alice (locks Bob first)")
	fmt.Println()

	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	wg.Add(2)
	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		transferUnsafe(alice, bob, 100) // locks Alice, then Bob
	}()
	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		transferUnsafe(bob, alice, 50) // locks Bob, then Alice -- OPPOSITE ORDER
	}()

	wg.Wait() // never returns -- both goroutines are blocked
	fmt.Println("This line is never reached")
}

func main() {
	demonstrateDeadlock()
}
```

Expected output (then freeze):
```
=== DEADLOCK DEMO (will freeze) ===
Two transfers locking in opposite order:
  Transfer 1: Alice -> Bob (locks Alice first)
  Transfer 2: Bob -> Alice (locks Bob first)

  Transfer Alice->Bob: locked Alice
  Transfer Bob->Alice: locked Bob
  Transfer Alice->Bob: waiting for Bob...
  Transfer Bob->Alice: waiting for Alice...
fatal error: all goroutines are asleep - deadlock!
```

**WARNING:** This program will hang. Press Ctrl+C to kill it. Go's runtime detects the deadlock only because ALL goroutines are blocked.

### Intermediate Verification
Run it and observe the freeze. The two transfers each hold one lock and wait for the other.

## Step 2 -- Analyze the Circular Wait

```
Timeline:
  T0: Transfer 1 locks Alice,  Transfer 2 locks Bob        (both succeed)
  T1: Transfer 1 wants Bob     (held by Transfer 2)       -- BLOCKED
      Transfer 2 wants Alice   (held by Transfer 1)       -- BLOCKED

  Transfer 1 --> waits for Bob   --> held by Transfer 2
  Transfer 2 --> waits for Alice --> held by Transfer 1

  Circular dependency. Neither can proceed.
```

The root cause: Transfer 1 acquires locks in order `Alice, Bob` while Transfer 2 acquires them in order `Bob, Alice`. This inconsistency creates the possibility of circular wait.

In production, this deadlock is far worse than it looks. If your server has a listening goroutine (which it always does), Go's runtime deadlock detector does NOT trigger. The transfers hang silently while the server appears to be running. Users see timeouts. No error is logged. The only symptom is that transfer-related requests stop completing.

## Step 3 -- Fix with Consistent Lock Ordering

Always lock the account with the lower ID first, regardless of which is "from" and which is "to":

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

const (
	initialBalance       = 1000
	transfersPerDir      = 100
	transferAmount       = 10
)

type Account struct {
	ID      int
	Name    string
	mu      sync.Mutex
	balance int
}

func NewAccount(id int, name string, balance int) *Account {
	return &Account{ID: id, Name: name, balance: balance}
}

// lockInOrder acquires locks by ascending account ID to prevent deadlocks.
func lockInOrder(a, b *Account) (*Account, *Account) {
	if a.ID > b.ID {
		return b, a
	}
	return a, b
}

func transferSafe(from, to *Account, amount int) bool {
	first, second := lockInOrder(from, to)

	first.mu.Lock()
	defer first.mu.Unlock()
	second.mu.Lock()
	defer second.mu.Unlock()

	if from.balance < amount {
		return false
	}
	from.balance -= amount
	to.balance += amount
	return true
}

func runBidirectionalTransfers(alice, bob *Account, rounds, amount int) {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	for i := 0; i < rounds; i++ {
		wg.Add(2)
		go func() {
			defer wg.Done()
			transferSafe(alice, bob, amount)
		}()
		go func() {
			defer wg.Done()
			transferSafe(bob, alice, amount)
		}()
	}

	wg.Wait()
}

func main() {
	alice := NewAccount(1, "Alice", initialBalance)
	bob := NewAccount(2, "Bob", initialBalance)

	fmt.Println("=== SAFE TRANSFERS (consistent lock ordering) ===")
	fmt.Printf("Before: Alice=%d, Bob=%d\n\n", alice.balance, bob.balance)

	runBidirectionalTransfers(alice, bob, transfersPerDir, transferAmount)

	totalMoney := alice.balance + bob.balance
	fmt.Printf("After:  Alice=%d, Bob=%d\n", alice.balance, bob.balance)
	fmt.Printf("Total:  %d (must be %d -- money is conserved)\n", totalMoney, initialBalance*2)
	fmt.Println("\nNo deadlock. Consistent lock ordering breaks the circular wait.")
}
```

Expected output:
```
=== SAFE TRANSFERS (consistent lock ordering) ===
Before: Alice=1000, Bob=1000

After:  Alice=1000, Bob=1000
Total:  2000 (must be 2000 -- money is conserved)

No deadlock. Consistent lock ordering breaks the circular wait.
```

### Intermediate Verification
```bash
go run -race main.go
```
No deadlocks, no data races. Total money is conserved. Run it multiple times -- it never hangs.

## Step 4 -- Multi-Account Transfers at Scale

A realistic banking system has many accounts. The same principle applies -- always lock by ascending ID:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
	"sync"
	"sync/atomic"
)

const (
	numAccounts      = 5
	initialBalance   = 10000
	numTransfers     = 10000
	maxTransferAmount = 100
)

type Account struct {
	ID      int
	mu      sync.Mutex
	balance int
}

func NewAccount(id, balance int) *Account {
	return &Account{ID: id, balance: balance}
}

func transfer(from, to *Account, amount int) bool {
	first, second := from, to
	if from.ID > to.ID {
		first, second = to, from
	}

	first.mu.Lock()
	defer first.mu.Unlock()
	second.mu.Lock()
	defer second.mu.Unlock()

	if from.balance < amount {
		return false
	}
	from.balance -= amount
	to.balance += amount
	return true
}

func createAccounts(count, balance int) []*Account {
	accounts := make([]*Account, count)
	for i := range accounts {
		accounts[i] = NewAccount(i+1, balance)
	}
	return accounts
}

func pickRandomPair(count int) (int, int) {
	fromIdx := rand.Intn(count)
	toIdx := rand.Intn(count)
	for toIdx == fromIdx {
		toIdx = rand.Intn(count)
	}
	return fromIdx, toIdx
}

func runStressTest(accounts []*Account, transferCount int) int64 {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	var successCount atomic.Int64

	for i := 0; i < transferCount; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go func() {
			defer wg.Done()
			fromIdx, toIdx := pickRandomPair(len(accounts))
			amount := rand.Intn(maxTransferAmount) + 1
			if transfer(accounts[fromIdx], accounts[toIdx], amount) {
				successCount.Add(1)
			}
		}()
	}

	wg.Wait()
	return successCount.Load()
}

func totalBalance(accounts []*Account) int {
	total := 0
	for _, acct := range accounts {
		total += acct.balance
	}
	return total
}

func printStressTestResults(accounts []*Account, totalBefore int, succeeded int64) {
	fmt.Printf("\nTransfers attempted: %d\n", numTransfers)
	fmt.Printf("Transfers succeeded: %d\n", succeeded)
	fmt.Println("\nFinal balances:")
	for _, acct := range accounts {
		fmt.Printf("  Account %d: $%d\n", acct.ID, acct.balance)
	}
	totalAfter := totalBalance(accounts)
	fmt.Printf("\nTotal before: $%d\n", totalBefore)
	fmt.Printf("Total after:  $%d\n", totalAfter)
	fmt.Printf("Money conserved: %v\n", totalBefore == totalAfter)
}

func main() {
	accounts := createAccounts(numAccounts, initialBalance)
	totalBefore := totalBalance(accounts)

	fmt.Println("=== Multi-Account Transfer Stress Test ===")
	fmt.Printf("Accounts: %d, each starting with $%d\n", numAccounts, initialBalance)

	succeeded := runStressTest(accounts, numTransfers)
	printStressTestResults(accounts, totalBefore, succeeded)
}
```

Expected output:
```
=== Multi-Account Transfer Stress Test ===
Accounts: 5, each starting with $10,000

Transfers attempted: 10000
Transfers succeeded: 8547

Final balances:
  Account 1: $11234
  Account 2: $8765
  Account 3: $12098
  Account 4: $7654
  Account 5: $10249

Total before: $50000
Total after:  $50000
Money conserved: true
```

### Intermediate Verification
```bash
go run -race main.go
```
No deadlocks, no data races. Total money across all accounts is always conserved at $50,000.

## Common Mistakes

### Locking Based on Parameter Order

```go
func transfer(from, to *Account, amount int) {
    from.mu.Lock()   // depends on which account is "from"
    to.mu.Lock()     // different callers may reverse this
    // ...
}
```

**What happens:** `transfer(A, B, 100)` and `transfer(B, A, 50)` running concurrently create a deadlock.

**Fix:** Lock based on a stable ordering (ID, address, name), not the parameter position.

### Assuming the Runtime Always Detects Deadlocks
Go's deadlock detector only triggers when ALL goroutines are blocked. In a real server with a listening goroutine, HTTP handler goroutine, or ticker, deadlocks between other goroutines go completely undetected. The program hangs partially: some requests complete, others never do. This is harder to diagnose than a full crash.

### Lock Escalation
Acquiring more locks while already holding one is inherently risky. Minimize nested locking. If you must hold two locks, document the lock ordering invariant clearly:

```go
// lockOrdering documents the required lock acquisition order.
// Always lock the lower-ID account first to prevent deadlocks.
// Invariant: for any pair (A, B) where A.ID < B.ID, lock A before B.
```

### Trying to Detect Deadlocks with Timeouts

```go
// Tempting but fragile
select {
case <-time.After(5 * time.Second):
    log.Fatal("possible deadlock")
}
```

This hides the real problem. Fix the lock ordering instead. Timeouts for deadlock detection are a band-aid that makes debugging harder.

## Verify What You Learned

Implement a dining philosophers problem with 5 philosophers and 5 forks (mutexes). First, show the deadlock when each philosopher picks up their left fork then their right. Then fix it using consistent lock ordering (always pick up the lower-numbered fork first). Run 1000 iterations and verify no deadlock occurs.

## What's Next
Continue to [09-sync-map-concurrent-access](../09-sync-map-concurrent-access/09-sync-map-concurrent-access.md) to learn how `sync.Map` provides a concurrent-safe map without external locking.

## Summary
- Deadlock occurs when goroutines form a circular dependency waiting for locks
- The most common real-world cause: transferring between two resources, each with its own lock, in inconsistent order
- Go's runtime detects deadlocks only when ALL goroutines are blocked -- partial deadlocks are invisible
- The primary fix is consistent lock ordering: always acquire locks in the same global order
- Use a stable key (ID, address) to determine lock order, not parameter position
- Minimize nested locking: if you can avoid holding two locks at once, do so
- Document lock ordering invariants for any code that acquires multiple locks
- In production servers, partial deadlocks are worse than crashes because they are silent
