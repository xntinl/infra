# 8. Race-Free Design Patterns


## Learning Objectives
After completing this exercise, you will be able to:
- **Design** concurrent programs where races are impossible by construction
- **Apply** confinement: a single goroutine owns the data, receiving commands via channel
- **Apply** immutability: pass copies instead of references so goroutines cannot interfere
- **Apply** producer-consumer with ownership transfer: data flows through a pipeline with clear handoffs
- **Combine** all three patterns in a complete request processor

## Why Design Patterns Over Fixes

Exercises 03-05 showed how to **fix** races after they occur: add a mutex, use a channel, use atomics. These are reactive approaches. This exercise takes the proactive approach: design your concurrent code so that races **cannot happen**.

The principle: **the best race fix is making races impossible by design.**

Three design patterns achieve this:

| Pattern | Mechanism | No Race Because |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Confinement** | Single goroutine owns the data, receives commands via channel | No concurrent access |
| **Immutability** | Pass copies, not references | Goroutines cannot modify shared data |
| **Ownership Transfer** | Data passes through a pipeline; only the current stage owns it | At any moment, exactly one goroutine owns each piece of data |

When you combine these patterns, you write concurrent code that is **correct by construction**, not by careful locking.

## Step 1 -- Confinement: Channel-Based Metrics Collector

Confine data to one goroutine that processes commands. This is the pattern from exercise 04 applied as a design principle. No other goroutine ever touches the map:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

type metricsCmd struct {
	action   string
	key      string
	resultCh chan<- map[string]int
}

type ConfinedCollector struct {
	cmdCh chan metricsCmd
}

func NewConfinedCollector() *ConfinedCollector {
	c := &ConfinedCollector{
		cmdCh: make(chan metricsCmd, 256),
	}
	go c.run()
	return c
}

func (c *ConfinedCollector) run() {
	counters := make(map[string]int)
	for cmd := range c.cmdCh {
		switch cmd.action {
		case "inc":
			counters[cmd.key]++
		case "snapshot":
			snap := make(map[string]int, len(counters))
			for k, v := range counters {
				snap[k] = v
			}
			cmd.resultCh <- snap
		}
	}
}

func (c *ConfinedCollector) Record(key string) {
	c.cmdCh <- metricsCmd{action: "inc", key: key}
}

func (c *ConfinedCollector) Snapshot() map[string]int {
	ch := make(chan map[string]int, 1)
	c.cmdCh <- metricsCmd{action: "snapshot", resultCh: ch}
	return <-ch
}

func (c *ConfinedCollector) Close() {
	close(c.cmdCh)
}

func main() {
	collector := NewConfinedCollector()
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	endpoints := []string{"/api/users", "/api/orders", "/api/products"}

	start := time.Now()
	for _, ep := range endpoints {
		for h := 0; h < 50; h++ {
			wg.Add(1)
			go func(endpoint string) {
				defer wg.Done()
				for r := 0; r < 100; r++ {
					collector.Record(endpoint)
				}
			}(ep)
		}
	}
	wg.Wait()
	elapsed := time.Since(start)

	fmt.Println("=== Pattern 1: Confinement ===")
	fmt.Println("The map is owned by a single goroutine. No concurrent access possible.")
	fmt.Println()
	snap := collector.Snapshot()
	total := 0
	for ep, count := range snap {
		fmt.Printf("  %-20s %d requests\n", ep, count)
		total += count
	}
	fmt.Printf("  %-20s %d requests (%v)\n", "TOTAL", total, elapsed)
	collector.Close()
}
```

Key design insight: the `counters` map is a local variable inside `run()`. It is never exported, never returned by reference, and never accessed by any other goroutine. The race is impossible by construction, not by locking.

### Verification
```bash
go run -race main.go
```
Expected: 5000 per endpoint, 15000 total, zero race warnings.

## Step 2 -- Immutability: Pass Copies, Not References

When processing requests, pass copies of data to each goroutine. Each goroutine gets its own independent snapshot that it can read (or even modify locally) without affecting anyone else:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
	"sync"
)

type Request struct {
	ID       int
	UserID   string
	Endpoint string
	Headers  map[string]string
}

func copyHeaders(src map[string]string) map[string]string {
	dst := make(map[string]string, len(src))
	for k, v := range src {
		dst[k] = v
	}
	return dst
}

func deepCopyRequest(r Request) Request {
	return Request{
		ID:       r.ID,
		UserID:   r.UserID,
		Endpoint: r.Endpoint,
		Headers:  copyHeaders(r.Headers),
	}
}

type ProcessingResult struct {
	RequestID int
	Summary   string
}

func processRequest(req Request) ProcessingResult {
	// Safe to read and even modify req: it is our own copy.
	req.Headers["X-Processed"] = "true"
	return ProcessingResult{
		RequestID: req.ID,
		Summary: fmt.Sprintf("user=%s endpoint=%s headers=%d",
			req.UserID, req.Endpoint, len(req.Headers)),
	}
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println("=== Pattern 2: Immutability (Pass Copies) ===")
	fmt.Println("Each goroutine gets a deep copy. Modifications are local only.")
	fmt.Println()

	baseHeaders := map[string]string{
		"Content-Type":  "application/json",
		"Authorization": "Bearer token-xyz",
	}

	requests := []Request{
		{ID: 1, UserID: "alice", Endpoint: "/api/users", Headers: baseHeaders},
		{ID: 2, UserID: "bob", Endpoint: "/api/orders", Headers: baseHeaders},
		{ID: 3, UserID: "charlie", Endpoint: "/api/billing", Headers: baseHeaders},
		{ID: 4, UserID: "diana", Endpoint: "/api/shipping", Headers: baseHeaders},
	}

	results := make(chan ProcessingResult, len(requests))
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	for _, req := range requests {
		wg.Add(1)
		copied := deepCopyRequest(req)
		go func(r Request) {
			defer wg.Done()
			results <- processRequest(r)
		}(copied)
	}

	go func() {
		wg.Wait()
		close(results)
	}()

	for res := range results {
		fmt.Printf("  Request %d: %s\n", res.RequestID, res.Summary)
	}

	// Original headers are untouched.
	fmt.Println()
	fmt.Printf("  Original headers still have %d entries (not modified)\n", len(baseHeaders))
	fmt.Printf("  Headers: %s\n", formatMap(baseHeaders))
}

func formatMap(m map[string]string) string {
	parts := make([]string, 0, len(m))
	for k, v := range m {
		parts = append(parts, fmt.Sprintf("%s=%s", k, v))
	}
	return strings.Join(parts, ", ")
}
```

Key design insight: `deepCopyRequest` creates a completely independent copy, including deep-copying the `Headers` map. Each goroutine can even modify its copy (adding `X-Processed`) without affecting anyone else. The original `baseHeaders` map remains untouched.

**Warning**: if you only do a shallow copy of a struct with map/slice/pointer fields, the goroutines still share the underlying data. Always deep-copy fields that contain references.

### Verification
```bash
go run -race main.go
```
Expected: all four requests processed correctly, original headers untouched, zero race warnings.

## Step 3 -- Ownership Transfer: Producer-Consumer Pipeline

Build a pipeline where data flows through stages. At each stage, ownership transfers: the sender relinquishes the data, the receiver takes full ownership. No two goroutines ever touch the same data simultaneously:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
	"time"
)

type LogEntry struct {
	Timestamp time.Time
	Level     string
	Message   string
	Source    string
}

type EnrichedEntry struct {
	LogEntry
	Normalized string
	Priority   int
}

type OutputRecord struct {
	EnrichedEntry
	FormattedLine string
}

func produce(entries []LogEntry) <-chan LogEntry {
	out := make(chan LogEntry)
	go func() {
		defer close(out)
		for _, entry := range entries {
			out <- entry // ownership transfers to the channel
			// After sending, the producer no longer uses this entry.
		}
	}()
	return out
}

func enrich(in <-chan LogEntry) <-chan EnrichedEntry {
	out := make(chan EnrichedEntry)
	go func() {
		defer close(out)
		for entry := range in {
			// We OWN this entry. No one else can access it.
			priority := 0
			switch entry.Level {
			case "ERROR":
				priority = 3
			case "WARN":
				priority = 2
			case "INFO":
				priority = 1
			}
			out <- EnrichedEntry{
				LogEntry:   entry,
				Normalized: strings.ToLower(entry.Message),
				Priority:   priority,
			}
		}
	}()
	return out
}

func format(in <-chan EnrichedEntry) <-chan OutputRecord {
	out := make(chan OutputRecord)
	go func() {
		defer close(out)
		for enriched := range in {
			line := fmt.Sprintf("[%s] P%d %-6s %s (%s)",
				enriched.Timestamp.Format("15:04:05"),
				enriched.Priority,
				enriched.Level,
				enriched.Normalized,
				enriched.Source)
			out <- OutputRecord{
				EnrichedEntry: enriched,
				FormattedLine: line,
			}
		}
	}()
	return out
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println("=== Pattern 3: Ownership Transfer (Producer-Consumer Pipeline) ===")
	fmt.Println("Each stage owns the data exclusively. No concurrent access.")
	fmt.Println()

	now := time.Now()
	entries := []LogEntry{
		{Timestamp: now, Level: "INFO", Message: "Server started on port 8080", Source: "main"},
		{Timestamp: now, Level: "INFO", Message: "Connected to database", Source: "db"},
		{Timestamp: now, Level: "WARN", Message: "Slow query detected (2.3s)", Source: "db"},
		{Timestamp: now, Level: "ERROR", Message: "Connection refused: redis:6379", Source: "cache"},
		{Timestamp: now, Level: "INFO", Message: "Health check passed", Source: "healthz"},
		{Timestamp: now, Level: "ERROR", Message: "Timeout calling payment API", Source: "billing"},
	}

	// Connect the pipeline: produce -> enrich -> format -> consume.
	produced := produce(entries)
	enriched := enrich(produced)
	formatted := format(enriched)

	for record := range formatted {
		fmt.Printf("  %s\n", record.FormattedLine)
	}

	fmt.Println()
	fmt.Println("Data flowed: produce -> enrich -> format -> consume")
	fmt.Println("At each stage, exactly one goroutine owned each LogEntry.")
	fmt.Println("No mutexes, no atomics, no races possible.")
}
```

Key design insight: each stage receives data from an input channel, processes it, and sends results to an output channel. After sending, the sender never touches that data again. After receiving, the receiver has full ownership. At no point do two goroutines access the same data. The pipeline is race-free by architecture, not by locking.

### Verification
```bash
go run -race main.go
```
Expected: six formatted log entries with correct priority levels, zero race warnings.

## Step 4 -- Combined: Complete Request Processor

Build a complete request processor that uses all three patterns together. This represents a realistic server middleware pipeline:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

// --- Immutability: deep copy requests ---

type IncomingRequest struct {
	ID       int
	Method   string
	Path     string
	UserID   string
	Headers  map[string]string
}

func copyRequest(r IncomingRequest) IncomingRequest {
	headers := make(map[string]string, len(r.Headers))
	for k, v := range r.Headers {
		headers[k] = v
	}
	return IncomingRequest{
		ID:      r.ID,
		Method:  r.Method,
		Path:    r.Path,
		UserID:  r.UserID,
		Headers: headers,
	}
}

// --- Ownership Transfer: pipeline stages ---

type ValidatedRequest struct {
	IncomingRequest
	IsAuthenticated bool
}

type ProcessedResult struct {
	RequestID  int
	StatusCode int
	Body       string
	Duration   time.Duration
}

func validate(in <-chan IncomingRequest) <-chan ValidatedRequest {
	out := make(chan ValidatedRequest)
	go func() {
		defer close(out)
		for req := range in {
			authenticated := req.Headers["Authorization"] != ""
			out <- ValidatedRequest{
				IncomingRequest: req,
				IsAuthenticated: authenticated,
			}
		}
	}()
	return out
}

func process(in <-chan ValidatedRequest) <-chan ProcessedResult {
	out := make(chan ProcessedResult)
	go func() {
		defer close(out)
		for vr := range in {
			start := time.Now()
			status := 200
			body := fmt.Sprintf("OK: %s %s for user %s", vr.Method, vr.Path, vr.UserID)
			if !vr.IsAuthenticated {
				status = 401
				body = "Unauthorized"
			}
			out <- ProcessedResult{
				RequestID:  vr.ID,
				StatusCode: status,
				Body:       body,
				Duration:   time.Since(start),
			}
		}
	}()
	return out
}

// --- Confinement: metrics collector goroutine ---

type metricsCmd struct {
	key      string
	resultCh chan<- map[string]int
}

func metricsCollector() (record func(string), snapshot func() map[string]int, stop func()) {
	cmdCh := make(chan metricsCmd, 128)
	snapCh := make(chan metricsCmd, 1)
	done := make(chan struct{})

	go func() {
		defer close(done)
		counters := make(map[string]int)
		for {
			select {
			case cmd, ok := <-cmdCh:
				if !ok {
					// Drain any pending snapshot requests.
					select {
					case s := <-snapCh:
						snap := make(map[string]int, len(counters))
						for k, v := range counters {
							snap[k] = v
						}
						s.resultCh <- snap
					default:
					}
					return
				}
				counters[cmd.key]++
			case s := <-snapCh:
				snap := make(map[string]int, len(counters))
				for k, v := range counters {
					snap[k] = v
				}
				s.resultCh <- snap
			}
		}
	}()

	record = func(key string) {
		cmdCh <- metricsCmd{key: key}
	}

	snapshot = func() map[string]int {
		ch := make(chan map[string]int, 1)
		snapCh <- metricsCmd{resultCh: ch}
		return <-ch
	}

	stop = func() {
		close(cmdCh)
		<-done
	}

	return
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println("=== Combined: Complete Request Processor ===")
	fmt.Println("Using all three race-free patterns together.")
	fmt.Println()

	recordMetric, getSnapshot, stopMetrics := metricsCollector()

	requests := []IncomingRequest{
		{ID: 1, Method: "GET", Path: "/api/users", UserID: "alice",
			Headers: map[string]string{"Authorization": "Bearer abc"}},
		{ID: 2, Method: "POST", Path: "/api/orders", UserID: "bob",
			Headers: map[string]string{"Authorization": "Bearer def"}},
		{ID: 3, Method: "GET", Path: "/api/products", UserID: "anon",
			Headers: map[string]string{}},
		{ID: 4, Method: "DELETE", Path: "/api/users/5", UserID: "charlie",
			Headers: map[string]string{"Authorization": "Bearer ghi"}},
		{ID: 5, Method: "GET", Path: "/healthz", UserID: "monitor",
			Headers: map[string]string{}},
	}

	// Immutability: deep-copy each request before sending into the pipeline.
	inputCh := make(chan IncomingRequest, len(requests))
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	for _, req := range requests {
		wg.Add(1)
		copied := copyRequest(req) // immutability
		go func(r IncomingRequest) {
			defer wg.Done()
			inputCh <- r // ownership transfer
		}(copied)
	}
	go func() {
		wg.Wait()
		close(inputCh)
	}()

	// Ownership Transfer: pipeline stages.
	validated := validate(inputCh)
	results := process(validated)

	// Consume results and record metrics (confinement).
	fmt.Println("Results:")
	for result := range results {
		status := "OK"
		if result.StatusCode != 200 {
			status = "FAIL"
		}
		fmt.Printf("  Request %d: [%d] %s (%v)\n",
			result.RequestID, result.StatusCode, result.Body, result.Duration)

		key := fmt.Sprintf("status_%d", result.StatusCode)
		recordMetric(key)
		recordMetric(status)
	}

	fmt.Println()
	fmt.Println("Metrics (confined to single goroutine):")
	snap := getSnapshot()
	for k, v := range snap {
		fmt.Printf("  %-15s %d\n", k, v)
	}

	stopMetrics()

	fmt.Println()
	fmt.Println("--- Design Summary ---")
	fmt.Println("  Immutability:       deep-copied requests before pipeline entry")
	fmt.Println("  Ownership Transfer: validate -> process pipeline, each stage owns the data")
	fmt.Println("  Confinement:        metrics map owned by a single collector goroutine")
	fmt.Println()
	fmt.Println("No mutexes. No atomics. Races are impossible by architecture.")

	// Verify original data is untouched.
	fmt.Println()
	original := requests[0].Headers
	fmt.Printf("Original request headers untouched: %v\n",
		!containsKey(original, "X-Processed"))
}

func containsKey(m map[string]string, key string) bool {
	_, ok := m[key]
	return ok
}

func formatHeaders(h map[string]string) string {
	parts := make([]string, 0, len(h))
	for k, v := range h {
		parts = append(parts, k+"="+v)
	}
	return strings.Join(parts, ", ")
}
```

This program demonstrates:
- **Immutability**: `copyRequest()` deep-copies each request before it enters the pipeline
- **Ownership Transfer**: `validate -> process` pipeline, each stage exclusively owns the data it receives
- **Confinement**: the metrics map is owned by a single goroutine, accessed only through function closures over channels

### Verification
```bash
go run -race main.go
```
Expected: all five requests processed, metrics collected, zero race warnings. No mutexes or atomics used anywhere.

## Common Mistakes

### Sharing Slices by Accident
```go
data := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
go func() {
    data[0] = 99 // modifies the underlying array
}()
fmt.Println(data[0]) // race: reads the same array
```
Slices contain a pointer to the underlying array. Passing a slice to a goroutine does NOT copy the elements. Use `copy()` or pass non-overlapping sub-slices.

### Thinking Structs Are Always Copied
Structs are copied by value when assigned or passed as parameters. However, if a struct contains **pointer fields, slices, or maps**, only the reference is copied, not the underlying data. Always deep-copy these fields.

### Breaking Ownership After Sending to a Channel
```go
out <- entry
entry.Level = "DEBUG" // BUG: you no longer own this data
```
After sending data to a channel, consider it gone. The receiver now owns it. Any modification after sending is a race.

## Design Decision Flowchart

1. **Can each goroutine work on its own copy of the data?** -> Immutability (simplest)
2. **Does data flow through stages?** -> Ownership Transfer (pipeline)
3. **Is there shared state that must be updated?** -> Confinement (channel-based owner)
4. **Is the shared state a simple counter?** -> `sync/atomic` (exercise 05)
5. **Is the shared state complex and high-contention?** -> `sync.Mutex` (exercise 03)

Always prefer design-level solutions (1-3) over fix-level solutions (4-5).

## Verify What You Learned

```bash
go run -race main.go
```

Confirm:
1. All patterns produce correct output
2. Zero race warnings from the race detector
3. No mutexes or atomics were needed

Answer these questions:
1. What is the difference between confinement and ownership transfer?
2. When does deep-copying become too expensive and you should use a mutex instead?
3. Why is "design for no races" better than "fix races with locks"?

## What's Next

You have completed the data races section. You now have a complete toolkit:

| Skill | Exercise |
|-------|----------|
| See the problem | 01 - Your First Data Race |
| Detect automatically | 02 - Race Detector Flag |
| Fix with mutex | 03 - Fix Race with Mutex |
| Fix with channel | 04 - Fix Race with Channel |
| Fix with atomic | 05 - Fix Race with Atomic |
| Handle map crashes | 06 - Subtle Race: Map Access |
| Avoid closure bugs | 07 - Race in Closure Loops |
| Design away races | 08 - Race-Free Design Patterns |

Apply these patterns in your own concurrent programs. When writing new concurrent code, start with the question: **"How can I design this so races are impossible?"**

## Summary
- **Confinement**: a single goroutine owns the data, receiving commands via channel; no concurrent access
- **Immutability**: deep-copy data so each goroutine has its own independent snapshot
- **Ownership Transfer**: data flows through pipeline stages; after sending, the sender relinquishes ownership
- Combining all three patterns yields concurrent code that is **correct by construction**
- No mutexes, no atomics, no locks needed when the architecture prevents sharing
- Design for no races is better than fixing races after the fact
- Always deep-copy structs with map/slice/pointer fields; shallow copies share underlying data
- `go run -race` is your verification tool: zero warnings confirms the design works
- **The best race fix is making races impossible by design**
